catalogs. It is stated that the 1934 issue was released for the benefit of the wounded in the Saudi-
Yemeni war. The 1936 issue was said to be released for public health purposes according to
Scott, and for the Makkah Hospital Fund according to Gibbons, although nothing to this effect
appears on the stamp itself. The Arabic on the stamp includes the word Isa'af which literally
means "medical aid". Mr. Thoden suggested that I investigate the matter further by reviewing the
Umm Al Qura newspaper which was the major source of news in Saudi Arabia, and is considered
now as the official government newspaper. Fortunately, we have the issues of Umm Al Qura on

	abstract = {In a previous article I wrote for Random Notes on the medical themes on Saudi Arabian stamps,
Mr. Rudy Thoden directed my attention to the postal tax stamps of 1934 and 1936. He stated that
not much is known about why these stamps were issued except for a few sentences in the
catalogs. It is stated that the 1934 issue was released for the benefit of the wounded in the Saudi-
Yemeni war. The 1936 issue was said to be released for public health purposes according to
Scott, and for the Makkah Hospital Fund according to Gibbons, although nothing to this effect
appears on the stamp itself. The Arabic on the stamp includes the word Isa'af which literally
means "medical aid". Mr. Thoden suggested that I investigate the matter further by reviewing the
Umm Al Qura newspaper which was the major source of news in Saudi Arabia, and is considered
now as the official government newspaper. Fortunately, we have the issues of Umm Al Qura on
microfilm in the Technical Library of Saudi Aramco back to 1925!},

Based on the official records, it contains specially prepared photographs of the head post offices of the foreign powers in Constantinople, a plan of Constantinople showing the location of these offices, tracings of postmarks and obliterations, photographs of actual specimens, and a large reference map indicating the location of all foreign post offices in the Levant and the principal mail routes.

Random Notes 19 showed a full plate of the 1/2pi surcharge in which the word guersh was inverted in the six stamps of the third line (see page 15). I had access to about 40 used stamps and none of them plated with that surcharge. A partial composite plate setting of these used stamps is shown on page 16. These stamps show distinct two dots over the “gaaf” and three dots over the “sheen”. The plate setting of RN19 only shows blobs over the “gaaf” and “sheen”, and the shape of the “haa” and “daal” are quite different suggesting that it is a forgery.},

	abstract = {This highly illustrated study examines, in detail, the brutal Paraguayan War of 1864--70, one of the largest and bloodiest conflicts in South American history. The Paraguayan War, also known as the War of the Triple Alliance, was the largest and most important military conflict in the history of South America, after the Wars of Independence, and its only true “continental” war. It involved four countries and lasted for more than five years, during which Paraguay fought alone against a powerful alliance formed by Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. This conflict was remarkable in its huge scale and its terrible cost in lives, with the catastrophic human price paid by Paraguay amounting to more than 300,000 men, a loss of some 70 percent of the country's total population.  The war was a real revolution for the armies of South America, and the first truly modern conflict of the continent. When the war began in 1864, the armies were small, poorly trained, and badly equipped semi-professional forces. However, by the time the war ended, most of them had adopted percussion rifles employing the Minié system and new weapons like breech-loading rifles and Gatling machine guns were being tested for the first time on the continent.  This title covers the whole span of the war, from when the early days the conflict primarily involved small columns of a few thousand men seeking each other out in rugged and sparsely inhabited territory, through to the later Napoleonic-style positional battles fought at points of strategic importance. It also explores the unique challenges presented by the humid, subtropical climate, including the devastating impact of disease on the troops.},

The book is directed mainly toward would-be collectors and beginning collectors of Egyptian stamps.  Presenting Egypt's postal history in a chronological manner gives the reader the historical context, and a brief description of life in Egypt is given during each period.  The currency, mainly coins, used to buy these stamps throughout each period is presented and illustrated to give an economic dimension to Egypt's postal history.},

Saudi Arabia, and more importantly, it was devoted exclusively to philatelic material related to
H. St J.B. Philby (Philby). Philby was the famous Arabist and advisor/confidant of Ibn Saud,
the first King of Saudi Arabia. Nothing that the author knows of has been written about this
auction.
The circumstances surrounding the auction have been put together by a few individuals who
were at the auction and the author’s discussions with those individuals. The author preserved
the original auction catalog.
During 1972 the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO in those days) acquired correspondence from Philby’s estate. ARAMCO approached the APA and asked if the APA was
interested in the covers. Presumably ARAMCO was more interested in the correspondence. All
of the correspondence was to Philby’s wife or Mother, Mrs. M. B. Philby. Philby’s wife, and
sometimes his Mother, noted the date received on the cover, as you will see. The APA was
extremely interested and said yes. ARAMCO put the following restrictions on the auction. One,
the sales proceeds would go into the treasury of the APA. Two, no publicity would attend the
sale.},

was unusual in two ways:
One, it is difficult to determine if this is a “CASOC” cover or a “BAPCO” cover. The sender
used an imprinted CASOC envelope, yet the sender put “Bapco Bahrain Island” as the return
address. The author could not locate the sender in any list of CASOC employees.
Secondly, this is a “Chungking” route cover that was described in RN \#83, page 15. Except this
cover was a double rate cover. The rate for a double rate cover would be 3½ annas for the basic
fee and 2 x 55 annas airmail fee for a total of 113½ annas.},

Since quantities printed were relatively small and all the values were exhausted from the Baghdad Post Office just seventeen days after they were put on sale, they fetched high prices from the very beginning. Numerous articles have been written about this issue over the years but none in great detail.

There has never been a proper census of the errors, while the covers bearing these stamps have not previously received the attention they deserve; no one really knew how many existed. This issue also had a political motive for its existence. Sir Percy Cox, the Chief Political Officer in Iraq, thought that the stamps would annoy the enemy and would also indicate the change of administration whereby the British replaced the defeated Turks. Much correspondence was exchanged between Iraq and the India Office, with the occasional involvement of King George V, before these stamps were eventually issued.

This book explains why and how the stamps were issued, and presents a full record of all known errors and covers as a reference for future collectors.},

Philby has been well documented both by himself and by others – and of course of his son Kim Philby who was eventually discovered to be a Russian spy. However the correspondence of this family has a major fascination not only because of their own story but also the prominent people they knew. Many of the covers from this correspondence were passed to the APA and found their way into  member’s collections. Several of these covers are particularly interesting as they are related to the postal history of Saudi Arabia both inward and outward.},

The Tughra design was first issued in 1934 and remained in service for 26 years until it was replaced in 1960 by the Dam, GOSP and Air definitives. Since the original work was published many advances have taken place in technology and also new findings made, so over the next 4-5 issues of Random Notes the individual values of this issue will be presented and readers are invited to bring up questions and observations for discussion. Then perhaps we can re-issue the monograph.},

No catalogue devoted to or including telegraph stamps has ever, so far as I can determine, listed any for Bolivia and I have still found no evidence that any were ever used. A set was certainly printed however because they are known overprinted for use as revenue stamps. The 1c and 2c were overprinted 'Tobacos' in 1906 (Forbin 15 \& 16) and the 10c and 50c were overprinted 'Transacciones/2 centavos' in 1908 (Forbin 30 \& 31). This latter pair were further overprinted 'Tobacos' at some later date. Either the set was prepared for use in or shortly before 1906 and it was decided not to employ specific telegraphic stamps after all, or they were used briefly but remained unnoticed by collectors — perhaps because the mode of use was such that they never passed into the hands of the public. Further information is required.

I have provisionally assumed that the set followed the general pattern of Bolivian postage stamp values of the time and that Forbin was correct in referring to them as "Telegraph Stamps of 1906" although I suspect they may have been earlier.

My note:
The introduction above mentions only the 1c, 2c, 10c and 50c, though his listing gave the correct colour of the 5c value, presumably because it is also known with a fiscal overprint (shown below). Specimens are now known, presumably sold from the archives of the American Bank Note Co. These have seven values up to 1B.},

The situation is not helped by the fact that cancellation with one or two pen strokes was virtually universal (I have a single dated
hand stamp cancellation). I would like to hear from anyone who has been able to conduct a more thorough study.

The stamps produced by the Colombian authorities for use in Panama, then under Colombian control, will be found listed under Panama.

This country has the distinction of being the only country which still uses telegraph stamps today. The most recent issue was authorized by Presidential decree in 1981. The first issue was by a French private company which was authorized to set up and run the first telegraph service
in the Republic. A reference in the American Philatelist to these being on sale at less than face value in 1890 suggests that they remained in use for around two years at the most and that the remaining stock reached the philatelic market. It is not known how telegrams were prepaid for the
following 30 years until the issue of the first official telegraph stamps in 1920.
Full philatelic details of issues since that of 1931 have not become available in time for this edition, although it is hoped that complete data will be available in due course. The numbers of each value issued between 1919 and 1981 are known and indicate a large usage.

My note:
Unfortunately Steve Hiscocks did not live to produce a subsequent edition.
Notice his reference to a 1931 issue. He did not list that issue, only the similar, but different issue of 1935 (see below).
There is some disagreement about the sequence of issues. This is not helped by the almost complete absence of dateable examples. 

Honduras issued stamps in 1981, and several more including a 1993 set. Hiscocks only knew of a 1934 set for Honduras.
Normally telegraph networks follow the railways, however the railways in the Dominican Republic appear to have had a slow start
The stamps of 1920 do not show railways, but instead show radiotelegraphy.},

other reference to these. He then lists the postage stamps of 1874 and 1875 with 'contra sello 1874' and 'contra sello' overprints respectively and
again I can find no further reference. The 1883—4 issue of the postage stamps of 1879 with 'contra sello' overprints in black and in violet appear in
all lists and are well known but Morley also lists the postage stamps of 1888 with the same overprint and again no other evidence is forthcoming.
The 'Timbres Para Telegrammas' and 'Timbre Para Cablegrammas' of 1896 seem straightforward although a series of notes in Morley's Journal
through 1901 adds a number of further values and varieties. There is also, however, the statement, said to originate from a correspondent in Salvador,
that the fiscal stamps of 1891 and perhaps of other years were used for telegraphic purposes and only bore a control number when intended for
telegraphic use. If this is so then the Salvador Telegraph list extends considerably and the 12 year gap between 1884 and 1896 is filled up to some extent.

In light of all this uncertainty and the difficulty of obtaining information from Salvador at the time of writing, I am for the time being, taking an
uncritical view and listing everything. Doubtful items have not however been priced. I would greatly welcome further information.

My notes:
Though the catalogues of Hiscocks, Scott and Barefoot each have overlapping information regarding the telegraphs,
unfortunately they are not entirely clear. My thanks to Carlos Quintanilla of the Asociación Filatélica Salvadoreña (AFISAL)
who has been very helpful in clarifying the topic of telegraph stamps in El Salvador.

I have re-arranged these into what I think is chronological order, but preserved references to Hiscocks numbering.
I have included some information on the early postal issues in an attempt to clarify some confusion that exists.

NOTE:—No coinage appears to have been minted in El Salvador between the Reales of 1873 and the Pesos of 1889.
For this reason, coins were in short supply. To alleviate this problem, stamps with various Contrasello
handstamps (reminiscent of the Type 5 Countermarks stamped on earlier coinage) were applied to postage stamps
which could then be used in place of coinage. This resulted in copious counterfeiting of the overprints.
Further overprint fakes were later produced to defraud collectors.},

At the time of the first specifically Panamanian telegraph stamps in 1892 the country was under the control of Colombia and the fist issue, inscribed
'Republic of Colombia, Department of Panama', are typical of Colombian designs. They are often listed under Colombia but inclusion under Panama
seems more appropriate. Panama became independent in 1903 but it was not until 1917 that telegraph stamps were introduced, first by overprinting
various old postage issues and then in 1919 by the issue of specific telegraph stamps. Such efficiency was unfortunately short-lived and the issue of
overprinted postage stamps continued from 1924 to 1935. Presumably postage stamps were used without overprints between 1903 and 1917 and after 1935.

The stamps used for telegraphic purposes in Peru are themselves fairly straight-forward with two series of specifically telegraph stamps separated by a series of overprinted postage stamps and a pair of overprinted postage due stamps. The use of postage due stamps is unusual. There is some uncertainty however over the 'overprints' of 'PERU' and the name of a town in capitals on two lines commonly found on all but (in my experience) the
first (1876-96) series. Walter Morley, in a series of notes in his journal during 1901, regards these as town overprints applied before sale and lists dozens of them on various values in various colours. An examination of those that have come my way suggest that these were not overprints but were the standard form of cancellation from around 1896 onwards. All those I have found without such a cancellation have been clearly mint and possessed of their original gum while all those bearing the PERU / Town cancellations have no gum and no sign of other cancellation. Subject to correction I therefore conclude that the standard form of cancellation after about 1896 was a neat hand stamp of PERU / Name of town in black, blue-black, purple, blue, green, magenta, or red, fairly centrally placed, although at random orientation, on each stamp. Those reported with
additions from my own collection, are listed below. No doubt there are many more to be added.

My note:
I have added images of telegraphic items before the telegraph stamps were issued,
as well as some fake overprints that have come to light.
The catalogue of John Barefoot, illustrates a couple of stamps having cancels not on the list above. These are: PERU / PISCO (blue-black?) and, interestingly, LIMA / NORTE (purple), on this, 'LIMA' is smaller than usual.},

	shorttitle = {The {Chaco} {War}, 1932-1935},
	abstract = {The Chaco War was the first modern conflict in South America. Over time, it became the topic of many volumes published in both Bolivia and Paraguay – first by veterans, such as the commanders-in-chief, and the commanders of army corps’, regiments or battalions, and by other ranks, in the form of personal memoirs or wider histories, and using a wide variety of sources. Subsequently, the conflict attracted attention of many foreign writers, foremost from the United States of America and Europe, who researched it with great interest. Hundreds of related articles have also been published.Nevertheless, The Chaco War, 1932-1935 is the first ever concise history of this conflict, providing the reader with the full background to this conflict, the military build-up of the Bolivian and Paraguayan armed forces, a blow-by-blow account of Bolivian penetration of this territory since the early 20th Century, precise details on troops mobilized for the war by both sides, all of the battles fought between the belligerents, and their casualties.Two very different military concepts faced each other: the German General Hans Kundt, a First World War veteran, hired by the Bolivian Government, was a proponent of the typical Prussian tactics of front attacks regardless of cost, but also of the strategy of taking and controlling as much territory as possible without annihilating the enemy.The Paraguayan Lieutenant-Colonel José Felix Estigarribia (later promoted to Colonel, and then General), took his specialization courses in Chile and France, and was a proponent of tactics of using trench warfare for defense, and flanking the enemy when in the offensive.Eventually, Estigarribia’s ideas proved their worth – partially because his forces managed to capture huge stocks of Bolivian arms and ammunition throughout the war.This is also the first book to provide an exclusive collection of photographs from the archives of the Institute of History and Military Museum of Ministry of National Defence of Paraguay, and several private archives in Paraguay and Bolivia.Perfectly complementing the earlier volume The Chaco Air War of the Latin America@War series, The Chaco War, 1932-1935 provides an indispensable, single-point-source-of-reference for enthusiasts and professionals alike.},

	shorttitle = {Andean {Tragedy}},
	abstract = {The year 1879 marked the beginning of one of the longest, bloodiest conflicts of nineteenth-century Latin America. The War of the Pacific pitted Peru and Bolivia against Chile in a struggle initiated over a festering border dispute. The conflict saw Chile’s and Peru’s armored warships vying for control of sea lanes and included one of the first examples of the use of naval torpedoes. On land, large armies using the most modern weapons—breech-loading rifles, Gatling guns, and steel-barreled artillery—clashed in battles that left thousands of men dead on the battlefields. Eventually, the warring parties revamped their respective military establishments, creating much needed, civilian-supported supply, transportation, and medical units. Chile ultimately prevailed. Bolivia lost its seacoast along with valuable nitrate and copper deposits to Chile, and Peru was forced to cede mineral rich Tarapaca and the province of Arica to the victor. Employing the primary and secondary sources of the countries involved, William F. Sater offers the definitive analysis of the conflict's naval and military campaigns. Andean Tragedy not only places the war in a crucial international context, but also explains why this devastating conflict resulted in a Chilean victory.},

The ten papers describe a wide range of techniques for stamp identification and expertizing. Several describe the use of visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light to discriminate among printings of the same design. Others report nondestructive analyses of ink chemistry to document how inks were modified over time. One paper explains the use of high-resolution imaging to measure distortion in printing plates, a technique that shows promise for faster identification of a stamp’s plate position. Together the papers illustrate philatelic applications of a wide range of equipment, including desk-top scanners, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), Fourier-transform infrared fluorescence (FTIR), and ultraviolet fluorescence.},

cancellations on Ottoman stamps within the prestigious “Cancellations of the Ottoman
Empire” as reported by prominent scholars. It also serves as a complete electronic index
of major publications in this area, each having different formats and conventions for
identifying and listing. Over 6500 Ottoman cancellations from more than 1800 sites of
the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, Near \& Middle East are included. Although a
complete development by itself, OCIT is taken as a first step for future extensions for
integrating collections of different items under common criteria and a variety of
scientific objectives. Key problems encountered are reported and functional extensions and generalization of scope are suggested. This aims at a generic indexing and cataloguing tool for cultural heritage collections. Fragments have to be mutually identified as being instances of the same prototype (the die used), which however is unknown. It is manifest able only through partial, hopefully partly overlapping strikes. Query constructs in common use, like wildcards, are not sufficient. Special emphasis is given to metadata annotations and links to historical events and geographic / chronological assignment, consistency in distributed use and retrospective structural updates under collaborative control.},

To facilitate this, IAP provides Research Grants and technical support to qualified philatelists to assist them in performing their valuable work. Our goal is to assist philatelists in gaining new insight and knowledge of stamps through the application of rigorous scientific methods. Because one of the most important aspects of research is the dissemination of results, all philatelists receiving grants from IAP are required to publish in widely circulated journals of record, both scientific and philatelic.

As a virtual organization, our Web Site is dedicated to providing all philatelic students with announcements of new scientific research in philately and an archive of research in our Reference Library.},

	abstract = {The Postal Issues of Hejaz, Jeddah and Nejd is a descriptive catalog of the postage stamps issued by the Arabian jurisdictions noted in the title. The work is generously provided with analytic photographs and engravings of calligraphic and ornamental detail, including overprints, misprints, variations in ornamental borders and calligraphy, paper, and perforation, and notes on forgeries. According to the author, the stamps were designed in Cairo and most were printed there at the Survey of Egypt facilities. The catalog is preceded by a brief introduction to the political and postal history, covering the years 1916‒27, of three regions in the present-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This book appears to have been one of the author’s very few ventures into analytical philately. She also collaborated with stamp dealer David Field (died 1926), her employer, on publication of a sale catalog entitled The Postage Stamps of the Hejaz, Jeddah and Nejd: A Complete and Illustrated Price-List of the 1924 Provisionals, Including all Subsequent Issues up to June 1926, also present in World Digital Library. The volume presented here is meticulously printed and contains commentary on postal issues in the short-lived Kingdom of Hijaz and its successor, the early Saudi kingdom of ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Sa’ud (1880‒1953). The design of some of the stamps from this region has been attributed to T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia, 1888‒1935), although this has not been confirmed. Little is known of the author, who died young. The book was published by Field in a limited edition of 350 copies and never reprinted for wider sale. The illustrator, John Calcott Gaskin, can be identified as a British colonial officer who served in Bahrain and Iraq and who was interned in Aleppo in 1915‒18. The color folding map of the Arabian Peninsula was produced by London engraver Geographia. Until the embryonic states of the Arabian Peninsula began to extract commercial quantities of oil in the 1950s, income from postage stamps was an important revenue source.},

The method presented was developed by biologists to estimate animal populations. Such estimates are done by first capturing, marking, and releasing specimens and then recapturing them. From these data, statistics may be developed to estimate the total population. The latest-generation computer software used for such analyses, called MARK, was developed by Gary C. White and others at Colorado State University. 
This paper explains how MARK may be used by everyday philatelists interested in estimating
the number of rare or very scarce stamps or covers in their collecting area. The methods described do not require one to be a mathematician to use them successfully. The methodology is then applied to four test cases in order to illustrate the efficacy of
the approach.},

	isbn = {1948-5999 948-6006},
	abstract = {The London printings of the Chilean postage stamps between 1853 and
1862 were examined using analytical instruments available at the Smithsonian Institution.
There are four broad major technical areas important to philatelic research: color
science (colorimetry and luminescence), paper chemistry (composition, thickness, and
roughness), ink chemistry (pigment and binder composition), and printing methods (engraving
and lithography). The analyses performed in this study address these four broad
major technical areas while providing an understanding of the characteristics of these
stamps, showing the utility and capability of forensic and scientific equipment available
to philatelic researchers and offering an effective, rapid, and nondestructive way
of identifying the pigments and dyes in the inks and papers used. X-ray
fluorescence
(XRF), Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), colorimetry, and X-ray
diffraction
(XRD) were all used on the stamps without damaging the samples. In some cases
different XRF and FTIR manufacturers were used to compare the capabilities of different
instruments in analytical philately. Because of the significant sensitivity differences
of the equipment, the results are often complementary. Only by combining the results
from several pieces of equipment was it possible to gather enough information to fully
differentiate between the stamps and to obtain the complete characterization for each
ink, pigment, and paper. This paper gives guidance as to which scientific instruments and
methods are most useful when examining different characteristics of stamps. The results
show the inks vary considerably between different printings. In the various red inks used
by Perkins, Bacon \& Co. the variation in the amounts of iron, calcium, and potassium
used in the stamps examined show printer experimentation in the recipe used to make
the ink. However, comparison between two blue inks used between 1853 and 1862 show
little variation in the components used. This suggests much of the variation in the red ink
recipe is due to Perkins, Bacon \& Co. trying to solve the bluing problem present in many
of their stamps during this time period.},

	abstract = {The Rosette Eagle stamps of Mexico have been known for over 100 years but are of uncertain status. Evidence suggested that plates for the Rosettes had been engraved in 1863 as a lanned issue of Mexican stamps, but that the stamps were not printed until many years later by stamp dealers who had obtained original plates of the1856-1861 Hidalgo stamps of Mexico which they used to manufacture private reprints. The texture of the paper was examined and found to be unlike any of early Mexican stamps but closely similar to that of the reprints. Microscopic fiber analysis was conducted of a variety of Mexican stamps from 1856 to 1894, samples of the Rosette Eagles, and reprints. All Mexican stamps tested from 1856 to the early 1880s were made entirely of rag paper with cotton and flax fibers. Grass fibers such as wheat and softwood fibers did not appear until the 1880s. The Rosette Eagles’ paper was found to be made entirely of softwood and grass fibers, with no rag content. Several reprints of the early Hidalgo stamps were tested and found to have fiber content very similar to the Rosettes. This analysis confirmed the Rosette Eagles were not printed in the 1860s, but rather years later, likely by the persons who made the reprints.},

	isbn = {978-0-578-64245-1},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to lay the groundwork for scientific analyses of the Imperial  Brazilian postal stamps via a case study of the Cottens essays, the Emperor Peter II white-eard Brazilian postal essays that were not issued. The stamps might have been issued had the Empire continued and the Republic not been proclaimed in 1889. These essays have a  nebulous history replete with myths about their origin. Their history was elucidated by means of comparison of these essays with Imperial Brazilian stamps, issued in the period by “Casa da Moeda do Brasil” – the Brazilian Mint. Further insights were gained by comparisons to mperial Brazilian postal stamps made by the American and Continental Bank Note Companies and to French stamps (considering myths of a possible French origin).
Non-destructive analytical methods were used to create a database of chemical and physical characteristics of inks and papers of the analysed stamps. Energy Dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) was done using an X-ray tube with silver filament and a Si-Drift detector both from Amptek®. We also used an electrostatic Pelletron-tandem particle accelerator type 5SDH for ion beam analysis and an external multi-use analyses station, which allowed analyses by ion beam analysis (IBA) without a vacuum. These techniques allowed the identification and quantification of chemical elements present in different materials. The optical microscope was used to identify the paper fibers. With these studies, differences were observed in the proportions of the chemical elements, but also differences in the elements used in the ink composition of the Cottens essays, as well as physical differences in the papers and manufacturing process.
Uncovering chemical signatures used during the Empire allowed significant conclusions to be drawn from both the Imperial Brazilian postal stamps and the Cottens essays. The Cottens essays presented different patterns in relation to the pigments used by the studied issuers, or the firms that printed and released the materials, and their origin cannot be determined. The analytical studies did not corroborate previous historical studies. The methods used did not allow for an exact definition of the pigments used in the studied samples, but worked very well as an exploratory research to give guidance for future works about standard definitions of elemental components of the pigments, and of paper thickness.},

It is the longest period in the postal history of the country, and it is deeply intertwined with the postal history of its sister countries in Central America, as El Salvador was part first of the Kingdom of Guatemala and then of the Central American Federation until its break‐up in 1839. Accordingly, this handbook covers the development of the postal service and the introduction of prestamp markings throughout four distinct chronological eras: The Early Colonial Period (1500s‐1763), The Bourbon Reforms (1764‐1821), The Federation Period (1821‐1839) and the Republican Period (1839‐1866). For each of these eras, The Prestamp Period of El Salvador provides a historical background and coverage of the developments in the postal service such as regulations, establishment of post offices, routes, rates and introduction of postal markings. It aids in the collecting of these markings by listing all those known for the country alongside illustrations of their use per era and an indication of their relative rarity.},

	abstract = {An in-depth look at the postal fraud that occurred in Mexico from 1870-1872 and the methods used by the Mexican government to counteract the fraud by means of using Anatado overprints and Habilitados. Presented by Nick Follansbee, Dr. Randall Grace and John Kordich during the Philately of the Americas Seminars at the Rocky Mountain Stamp Show in Denver Colorado in May 2019.

Nick Follansbee describes how postal forgeries came to be in Mexico in 1870-1871 and the effect these forgeries had on the Mexican postal system. Nick describes the means used to produce the forgeries and how the forgeries can be identified.

Dr. Randall Grace describes how Anatado overprints were employed by the Mexican postal authorities to prevent the unauthorized use of the postal forgeries and how this solution fell prey to forgery as well. Dr. Grace discusses in great detail the many ways that Anatado overprint forgeries can be identified.

John Kordich closes the presentation with a discussion of the use of Habilitados to further prevent the unauthorized use of the postal forgeries and how to identify fake Habilitados that began appearing shortly after their introduction by the Mexican postal authorities..},

	abstract = {An important collection covering the scarcest period of stamp issues in Colombia, and representing undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best ever formed of classic Colombia. The Exhibit is titled "Classic Colombia: The First Six Issues - 1859 to 1866' and is an internationally recognised FIP Large Gold medal winning collection at New York in 2015 and Brasilia in 2017. The exhibit includes essays and proofs, plate studies, shades, multiples, a wide range of cancellations, rare usages of early Colombian issues on cover, as well as the exceedingly scarce and sought after inverted clichés and clichés erroneously placed in their non-corresponding lithographic stones (transfer errors). Many of the rarities assembled in this collection have prestigious provenance, including pieces owned by Ferrary, Caspary, Burrus, Newbury, Neuburger, Jewell, Hubbard, Larsen, Goeggel, Kaplan, Londoño, Frohlich and Santamaría. It undoubtedly represents the largest number of important covers and multiples ever gathered in one Columbia exhibit. Formed by Ricardo Botero over a period of more than 50 years, and includes the finest examples known of Classic Colombia.},

	copyright = {Museum of Philately},
	url = {https://www.museumofphilately.com/collection/22},
	abstract = {Egypt developed a major presence, the Khedivial Mail Line, in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea in the 19th century. A postal service was established in the consulates at the ports in the Ottoman Empire served by it. A few years later, southward colonial expansion as far as Somaliland and the borders of Uganda led to the opening of a considerable number of Egyptian Post Offices, mostly in the Sudan. The Egyptian offices are the rarest of all the foreign offices in the Mediterranean, approached only by those of Russia. In the First Stage (1865-1867), the main lines were established: Alexandria to Constantinople via Smyrna, and Suez to Gedda. The Second Stage (1867-1869) saw the addition of post offices at intermediate ports: Galipoli, Dardanelles, Chios, Mytilene (Rhodes and Leros were added in 1872). In the Red Sea, the Second Stage saw extension to Suakin and Massawa in 1868, providing the first postal service in Eritrea. The Third Stage began in July, 1870 with a western loop along the coast of Thessaly: Cavala, Lagos, Salonika, Volos, Tenedos, and an eastern loop along the Sicilian and Syrian coasts: Mersina, Alexandretta, Latakia, Tripoli, Beyrout, Jaffa. These were an economic failure and were shut down in less than two years. The Fourth Stage saw further extension to Zeila and Berbera, the first post offices to function in Somaliland, and up the Nile by train, boat, and camel rider, to a range of towns in the Sudan: Kassala, Gedaref, Tokar, Khartoum, Dongola, Berber, Wadi Halfa, Dabrousa (and others known only as interpostal seals), plus Wadi Halfa Camp and temporary offices, Korti and Tani, to serve the military. Many place names have several spellings, according to how the Arabic version is translated. Many offices may be found with different spellings, for example Gedda, Jiddah or Djeddah. The rates at first were 1 piaster per 10g. port-to-port, inland postage extra, registration fee 2 piaster, printed matter 10 paras per 40g. With the advent of the UPU (on July 1st 1875), the consular offices were subject to the foreign rate, 1 piaster 20 paras (inland postage included), prints 20 paras per 50g.; the registration fee became 1 piaster. On April 1st 1878, the UPU letter rate was dropped to 1 piaster per 15g., and prints to 10 paras. All of the Mediterranean offices and Gedda were closed in 1881, and the other offices were turned over to the Postal Administration of the Sudan in 1897. This collection is presented in two groups. The first group is called Consular Offices. This is where Egyptian post offices existed at the Egyptian Consulates in ports of the Ottoman Empire, in which the civil administration was Turkish. The second group is called Territorial Offices, they were nominally Turkish, without postal service, until the Ottoman Sultan formally transferred the civil administration to Egypt. Most of Territorial Offices had little commercial importance, although Suakin was the port of embarkation for pilgrims from the Sudan bound for Gedda on the Hajj pilgrimage.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Plan Haiti both joined the U.P.U. and issued its first series of postage stamps on 1st July 1881. A set of six imperforate values were issued: le, 2c, 3c, 5c, 7c and 20c. The basic foreign letter rate was set at 10c but for some inexplicable reason there was no actual 10c stamp issued in Haiti until some seventeen years later in 1898 ! This exhibit concerns itself with the 1881-87 period "Liberty Head" imperforate and perforate issues.A new series of stamps with "Palm Tree" designs were issued in 1891 but previously issued stamps (mainly the "Liberty Head" 20c value) remained on sale at the post offices until stocks were finally exhausted sometime circa 1894 period. The postage rates that came into force in July 1881 remained unchanged throughout the period covered by this exhibit 1: The lmperforate "Liberty Heads" - Plate I (July 1881) - Frames 1-4 An introduction page is followed by a selection of proofs including the unique first "Liberty Head" dies originally prepared for fiscal stamps. The issued stamps include the le tete-beche partial double pane which is considered to be the first of the two "crown jewels" of Haiti Philately. Other items of particular note are the only recorded 3c sheet and the largest known mint multiples of the 5c, 7c and 20c values. Various largest recorded used multiples are also shown. The covers include many rare and unusual frankings with strip of four le double internal rate, pair 3c triple internal rate, foreign printed matter and postcard rates, a rare 5c rate to Jamaica, several different make-ups of 10c rates including combination usages with perforated stamps, double rates and all three of the recorded registered covers with either complete or partial imperf orate frankings. These include the registered cover to Germany with a strip of four of the 20c value which is considered to be the second of the two "crown jewels" of Haiti Philately 2: The Perforated "Liberty Heads" - Plate II- First and Second Printings (1882-1885) - Frames 5 - 6 This commences with two introduction pages covering all the perforated "Liberty Head" issues. It should be noted that earliest recorded usages of many the different stamps are shown throughout the perforated sections. A splendid range of the imperforate between varieties are also shown There were two printings from Plate II of all the five values from le to 7c but there was only one printing of the 20c value. There is a fine array of mint multiples with most of these being the largest recorded. All the different printings are also shown on an interesting array of covers with a wide variety of frankings and rates 3: The Perforated "Liberty Heads" - Plate III (1885-1886) - Frame 7 Only 2c, 5c and 20c values were printed from Plate III. The largest recorded mint multiples are shown for all three values as well as for the largest recorded used multiples including a remarkable piece with the franking including a block of 24 of the 20c value. A fine selection of covers include all three values. Finally a set of "reprints" with all six imperfoate values made from Plate III are also shown 4: The Perforated "Liberty Heads" - New Dies (1886-1887) - Frame 8 Only le, 2c and 5c values were printed from the new dies. The items shown include the master die proof for the le and 2c values followed by the largest recorded mint and used multiples of all three values plus a fine array of usages on cover 5: The Perforated "Liberty Heads" - Postal Forgeries (circa 1886) - Frame 8 The smallest section with just two pages but including a rare mint multiple of the 2c value and a unique usage of the 20c value on cover References \& Bibliography Haiti: The 'Liberty Heads' by J.R.W Purves - The Collectors Club Philatelist, serialized throughout Vol. 52.

	abstract = {Reference management software, citation management software, or bibliographic management software is software for scholars and authors to use for recording and utilising bibliographic citations (references) as well as managing project references either as a company or an individual. Once a citation has been recorded, it can be used time and again in generating bibliographies, such as lists of references in scholarly books, articles and essays. The development of reference management packages has been driven by the rapid expansion of scientific literature.
These software packages normally consist of a database in which full bibliographic references can be entered, plus a system for generating selective lists of articles in the different formats required by publishers and scholarly journals. Modern reference management packages can usually be integrated with word processors so that a reference list in the appropriate format is produced automatically as an article is written, reducing the risk that a cited source is not included in the reference list. They will also have a facility for importing the details of publications from bibliographic databases.
Reference management software does not do the same job as a bibliographic database, which tries to list all articles published in a particular discipline or group of disciplines. Such bibliographic databases are large and have to be housed on major server installations. Reference management software collects a much smaller database, of the publications that have been used or are likely to be used by a particular author or group, and such a database can easily be housed on an individual's personal computer.
Apart from managing references, most reference management software also enables users to search references from online libraries. These online libraries are usually based on Z39.50 public protocol. Users just need to specify the IP address, database name and keywords to start a Z39.50 search. It is quicker and more efficient than a web browser. However, Z39.50 is a little out of date. Some popular scientific websites, such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and arXiv, do not support the Z39.50 protocol.},

	abstract = {This book deals with the historical context in which two of the most famous stamps in Peru were issued, the "little train" and the "llama" (1870 and 1873, respectively). Both stamps illustrate various aspects of the time. The two decades preceding the issuance of these stamps were marked by the "false prosperity" generated by the guano boom. There were profound changes in the country and an important development of railways, which later suffered a strong setback. The "little train" stamp bears witness to this ephemeral development that was not sustainable. For its part, the stamp of the "llama" evokes the rich Peruvian fauna and, especially, the close relationship between the populations of the Andean zone and the camelids; a relationship that goes far beyond the role given to them as fiber producers, but as animals that had a central role in the economy, religion and culture. However, beyond what each of these stamps evokes, in them we can also see the tension between the development of a national industry and free trade. The first issues of Peruvian stamps, except for the provisional stamps of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, were first lithographed in Peru and then printed on the Lecoq machine that the Correo bought in 1861. Within a few years of use of the Lecoq machine there were those who they criticized the quality of the printing process and encouraged the purchase of stamps abroad. After some comings and goings, it was decided to buy abroad. A better printing press could have been bought and trained staff hired, but that opportunity was missed. It cannot be said in an absolute way that it would have been more economically efficient to develop a local print shop, but at least it leaves us wondering what would have happened if it had been done.},

Postal systems were set up by rulers in order to maintain control over vast tracts of land. These systems, invented centuries before steam-engines or cars, enabled the swift circulation of different commodities - from letters, people and horses to exotic fruits and ice. As the correspondence transported often included confidential reports from a ruler's provinces, such postal systems doubled as espionage-networks through which news reached the central authorities quickly enough to allow a timely reaction to events. The book sheds light not only on the role of communications technology in Islamic history, but also on how nomadic culture contributed to empire-building in the Near East. This is a long-awaited contribution to the history of pre-modern communications systems in the Near Eastern world.},

	abstract = {A report by New Zealand Broadcasting Service commentator Arch Curry and talk by Norman Nairn,  about the Nairn Transport Service which has connected Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut since 1923.

A four day trial of the Baghdad - Damascus service was made in 1923 with American tourists. Until that date the only transport available between these centres was by camel.

New Zealanders 2nd Lieut. Norman and Mess Orderly Gerry Nairn were demobilised in Egypt from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force after the end of World War I. They established a transport service in Beirut with a taxi service to Haifa.

The Nairns now use air-conditioned,  dust-proof, 80 foot-long bus tractor-trailers, each the size of a railway carriage, with its own buffet and refrigerator.  There are plans for new, tractorless units. Curry describes the passengers and the departure of a unit and then hands over to Norman Nairn who talks about the history of the operation which he and his brother Gerry have established.

Norman Nairn then talks about the problems which had to be overcome in setting up a desert transport service. It is now possible to travel from Damascus to Baghdad overnight in dust-free comfort.

He talks about the complications of running a company which operates in several countries and employs staff of eight different nationalities.

He explains the impact of the current war on their operations.},

	abstract = {One of the daunting aspects of studying the Middle East is the confluence of several, often unrelated, languages, each with its own alphabet. Having gained some control over these, the student then comes up against a jumble of calendars. While many of these complications are lessened when focusing on a particular region or period of time, the cosmopolitan nature of the Ottoman Empire evolved a dense fabric of interwoven languages (Persian, Turkish, and Arabic) and of calendars, which were not only in use alongside each other, but were blended to create new subspecies! Handbooks and concordances have existed for a long time to enable the scholar to translate solar, lunar, agricultural, and urban time reckonings into modern calendars. We are most familiar with the standard Gregorian/Hijra guides, as Europeans were once deeply involved in concordances of Old Style (Julian) and New Style (Gregorian) conversion tables.The Ottoman fiscal calendar is one of the more peculiar challenges which must be attended to, in order to control adequately the immense store of documents from the last centuries of the Turkish Empire. This calendar was employed particularly in the State’s fiscal and trade sectors; hereafter it is identified by the code SM, for sene-i-maliye, the fiscal year. It is a solar calendar, first put into use in AD 1676, and adopted by more areas of trade and administration until it becanle the official standard calendar of the empire in AD 1839. The supremacy of SM usage then lasted until AD 1917, when it was first modified to accord with Gregorian NS reckoning over Julian OS. Finally, SM usage was discontinued entirely in December of AD 1925, and replaced by the “Western” Gregorian calendar.},

In Cuba two types of this datestamp were used, their features being described, as well as their varieties and the colours used. In the town of Remedios two type II “baezas” are known, one received from Spain, the other locally produced. After the introduction of the adhesive stamp, in 1855, all the stamps were cancelled with the new “grill” canceller, but in some places this was used jointly with the “baeza” datestamp.},

until late in the 19th c. A variety of expressions on the covers indicated the urgency of each particular situation, and depending on the topography, foot runners could cover distances of up to 120 km per 24 hours. The first mention of such a service is also much earlier than heretofore assumed: it must have existed already prior to its mention in a request by the Correo Mayor of Guatemala to the Council of Indies during the first decade of the 18th c. Several other mentions
of the use of cordillera mails have been noted throughout the 18th c., but actual documents in collectos’ hands are all from the 19th c. They are of two main types: urgent messages sent between two individual points on the one hand, and circuit mail on the other hand. Latter carried government orders to a number of different towns and villages along a given route. The mayors and justices of each town had to confirm receipt and compliance to the order received on the
original document before organizing the cordillera’s conveyance to the place subsequently listed. Examples of 1875 and 1884 show that cordillera mail was still being used between places provided with post offices for matters too urgent to wait for the regular mail service!},

An inventory of 1783 confirms that they were never distributed, but all used in Guatemala. The earliest dated use of the marking is August 1779.

The initial requirement was that each prepaid letter had to be handwritten with the word “franca” and the name and/or rubric of the postmaster. Due to the rapid increase in the mail carried, this requirement quickly became onerous. Accordingly, various postmasters were authorized for this purpose by Madrid to have handstamps made which incorporated the word “franca” and their name or rubric. Interim administrators, appointed during the absence, illness or death of the postmaster were occasionally
granted this privilege as well. By the end of the eighteenth century, however, most of these handstamps were replaced with simple “franco” or “franqueado” markings. This article is the attempt by the authors to document and illustrate these markings. Thirty-two marks have been located to date. The dates provided refer to actual dates of usage, known periods of a particular postmaster in office, or when permission was granted for such a handstamp.

	abstract = {The birth of Mexico’s classical issues coincides with a period of great political turmoil, punctuated by the civil war, the December 1861 European intervention and the establishment of Maximilian’s monarchy.
Maximilian would be executed in June 1867, a few days before the triumphal entrance of Benito Juárez in the capital and the establishment of a Republican government. The first five-value Mexican stamp issue appeared on August 1, 1856, being reprinted on coloured paper in 1861, while the Maximilian “Eagles” issue was delivered to the post offices on May 8, 1864. The Civil War and the French intervention disrupted the normal operation of the postal services, what prompted the adoption of provisional measures to guarantee the normal mail transit. During this period, the postage was paid by using the “black seal” postmark (denoting pre-payment in cash), by provisional stamps printed by several post offices and by allowing the use of stamps of the 1856 and 1861 issues, already demonetised. The author displays examples of all the provisional uses he has been able to document, listed by their origin, and comments on today’s values of this material.},

It is possible though that new discoveries will be made in the future. The earliest forwarding

Later, around 1876, the Dominican government granted to other maritime companies concessions to carry mail by steamships and packets. The few letters from this period that have survived account for the difficulty to study the operation of the British mail in the Dominican Republic. The British postal authorities ordered the use of special cancellations to identify each office. Apart from the circular datestamps with each office’s name, numeral oval cancellations were also used in Puerto Plata (C86) and Santo Domingo (C87). The oldest known letter handled by the British postal system in the Dominican Republic was cancelled on September 12, 1867. The author has studied 53 covers carried by the British mails, a valuable prize that he divides into two periods –1867-1870 (12 covers) and 1875-1880 (41 covers).},

The stamps and envelopes received an overprint consisting of a cross of St Andrew and new values. In the subsequent months, H.K. Parisot was accused of being behind the business by exerting his influence on the president. Since then, the collectors call this the Parisot issue. The philatelic scandal of international proportions that followed caused catalogues of the time ignoring these stamps.

No envelope from or to Florida during the first Spanish period has been described until now. The first known letters from these territories date back to the British rule. The oldest one, originated in the capital city, San Agustín, is dated April 25, 1765. All these are all extremely rare pieces. During the second Spanish period a postal office, depending upon Havana, was established in San Agustín at the end of June 1784. The authors also survey the maritime postal activity, since practically the entire bulk of incoming and outgoing mail handled by the San Agustín post office was seaborne. They also research the postal rates applied to the ordinary correspondence received at San Agustín during the 18th Century and
the communications with North America and other destinations. Finally, they exhibit several letters from that time, highlighting one recently turned up with its contents intact, written at San Agustín on January 28, 1785 and bearing the unrecorded lineal postmark “FLORIDA” in light red.},

However, these were abandoned in 1751 for their lack of profitability. They were reinstated in 1767 and further expanded to Valparaiso. In July 1769, these inland posts were taken over by the Crown and unified with the so-called Maritime Post, created in 1764. In 1765 two maritime administrations were set up, one in Santiago de Chile, the other in Valparaiso, both dependent from Lima. One of the administrators introduced in 1767 the first handstamp of Chile to indicate the source of the letters addressed to Lima. The author describes the characteristics of these postmarks and offers graphic testimony of several folded letters circulated at the time.

Until that time, the mail apparatus was administrated under concessions granted to particular individuals (called Correos Mayores). Indeed, in 1514 Lorenzo Galindez Carvajal received the title of Correo Mayor of the Indies but he exercised this right only partially. The central hypothesis of the article suggests that the colonial mail was not organized in the same way in all Spanish possessions. Instead, the mail apparatus functioned combining different administrative strategies depending on the practical necessities of each viceroyalty. Although the Crown tried in principle to organize the mail into a single body of egulations, the most important viceroyalties and Audiencias distributed the written correspondence in a differentiated manner. The following sections identify the three main models of mail administration in Peru, New Spain and New Kingdom of Granada. In general, the Spanish American mail apparatus was perceived by colonial officials as flexible but perfectible subject to modification to address their particular needs.},

I propose that this mail system, in which official and unofficial postal services coexisted, allowed for an intense communicational experience; rather than restricting correspondence, mail circulated at unprecedented levels. To understand this system's rationale I focus on the figure of the correos mayores, who were responsible for the distribution of official information (or information of interest to the crown) within certain Spanish American cities. Using sources in American and European archives, I question the premise that Spanish American communication was chaotic during this period. I also argue that the exceptional circulation of mail within Spanish America and overseas during the sixteenth century is essential for understanding European expansion and the early modern world.},

	abstract = {In the late eighteenth century, Bourbon administrators of the postal system in Spain wrote to their subordinates in the Americas, asking for comprehensive topographic maps of the mail and post system, which had been steadily improved and expanded beginning in the 1760s. As part of the larger Bourbon reforms, the innovations to the mail system promised to shrink the vast Spanish empire, quickening communication, strengthening the bureaucratic chain of command, and drawing distant peripheries like Guatemala closer to the center. The administrators expected in reply, no doubt, aerial cartographic depictions of the kind then being produced in Spain: maps that would detail the breadth of the American postal systems with precise routes, placenames, and distances. In some places, certainly, such postal maps could be successfully produced. An 1804 document sent to administrators in Spain from Buenos Aires, for example, offers a detailed cartographic representation of the local ‘mail and postal offices,’ quantifying the distances along the mail routes from place to place. Place names and distances are identified alongside topographical features, such as the network of rivers and tributaries fanning out from Rı́o de la Plata. Spreading across the surface of the map like veins, the detailed waterways appear to dominate the landscape, filling the map with their prominent titles. But the map from Buenos Aires was not the universal representational model during the Bourbon era. Officials elsewhere chose other textual and visual forms to report on the spatial reach of their respective rentas. A Chilean ‘Table of the distances that exist between the cities and other principal places in the Kingdom of Chile, based on the most exact calculation possible according to estimates,’ dated 1772, places the quantification of distance at the axis of two place-names. Similar to a modern chart calculating driving distances, the Chilean chart maximizes the use of space on the page to quantify the distances between more than forty places.},

	abstract = {Delta Air Lines (Delta) is one of the great surviving legacy airlines of the first century of flight. In the annals of American aviation history its origins are unique. Delta's beginning can be traced to the arrival of the boll weevil from Mexico into Texas in 1892. Unlike other national airlines that were nurtured on mail subsidies, Delta evolved from experiments using airplanes to counter the cotton weevil scourge from the air. The iconic book on the subject is Delta: The History of an Airline authored by two eminent Auburn University history professors, W. David Lewis and Wesley Phillips Newton. This dissertation explores more closely the circumstances and people involved in Delta's early years up to World War II. It is chronologically organized and written in a narrative style. It argues Delta's development was the result of a decades-long incremental and evolutionary process and not the calculated result of a grand design or the special insight of any one person. Various individuals, influenced by diverse cultural, political, and economic factors, interacted to frame the outcome. The socio-technological system that is Delta today originated from a complex set of seemingly unrelated circumstances. The slightest variation might have modified, sidetracked, or even terminated the process. The search for primary source material determined the methodology undertaken for this study. The investigation led to each of the cities where Delta had an early connection and to libraries and repositories across the United States and in South iv America. A variety of diverse primary source materials, including government publications, newspaper articles, interviews, library subject files, and archival repositories, was accessed. Much of this information was unavailable to historians Lewis and Newton. This study explains how in its early years a large American legacy airline evolved from a small crop dusting company chartered to help save cotton from the boll weevil infestation in the southern United States. More Broadly, it contributes to the understanding of the origins of commercial aviation in the United States and the world.},

The paper then examines the digital philatelic collections of four large cultural heritage institutions, discussing the metadata standards and elements employed by these institutions.

Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the ability to classify images into thousands of classes with high precision. These neural networks have solved various computer vision related problems like object classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Deep learning applications have benefited fields ranging from security to cancer treatments, and in this paper we apply deep learning to the niche field of philately. The objective of this research is to recognize stamp features such as plate number and row and column letter using photographs of stamps. We use the Queen Victoria Penny Red stamp Scott 33, a legacy stamp issued in mid-nineteenth century Britain. This stamp is a hugely popular stamp among philatelists. For this research, approximately 130,000 of these stamps have been meticulously photographed and cataloged. Despite sometimes poor quality and strong cancellation marks, results demonstrate over 95\% accuracy on row/column recognition and 90\% plate recognition.},

	title = {The {Arab}-{Israeli} conflict : no service, returned and captured mail},
	isbn = {978-1-925086-58-4},
	abstract = {Daryl Kibble has written a fascinating account to sort out a very chaotic and confused era. When Great Britain terminated its mandate over Palestine, they took with them many of the government services including the posts. With the termination came the declaration of the State of Israel, military attacks from surrounding Arab states, and embargos on the transfer of mail to Israel.
The author organized his presentation of this early time period based upon the postal markings of the sending countries. This framework accounts for both the large volume mailers such as the United States and Great Britain as well as the one-of-a-kind such a Malaya. Egypt became the holding point for much of the mail during the embargo and Syria continued to process the mail, sending on to Jordan to figure out how to deliver it. The first chapter contains a very useful table listing dates of suspension and resumption of services from about every member of the UPU as well as images of primary sources retrieved from postal archives around the world.
The second chapter renders the story of the embargo from the perspective of the Arab states, a boycott that lasted from 1948 until the 1980s (or to the present for a few such as Lebanon) with varying levels of commitment. At least for the early years the embargo saw extensive use of censorship; the various tapes and markings used in Egypt form a subtheme of their own in the book as well as being the first time publication of such tapes and markings in the philatelic literature.
A boycott usually engenders a response and Israel was no exception in this regard. The author documents 34 types of postal markings used by the Israeli administration to return undeliverable mail to senders (only five had been identified in previous research). These instruction markings are found as rubber handstamps as well as mimeographed labels.
The “captured mail” aspect of the title refers to events related to the 1956 Suez action, with Israeli, British and French forces engaged to reopen the canal after Egyptian nationalization. This affected particularly hard the postal activities in the Gaza strip. More mail became “captured” during the Six-Day war in 1967 and produced an extensive postal history that Kibble explores in some depth, again for the first time in the philatelic literature in this detail.
Mail recovered from crashes has its own interest level. When associated with any of the acts of terrorism of the last half-century, the artifacts become poignant examples. By their nature, most of these examples are not common.
The author concludes with surveys of postal operations and source materials for the Palestinian Authority and HAMAS, as well as what he calls “Other Conflicts \& Incidents,” such as the Yom Kippur war and the 1991 Gulf War. Kibble maintains the high standard of scholarship.},

The tool to make meaningful measurements is available at an affordable price. The steps to take in interpreting your data are known and have been described.
An example of application of the method has been given by the study of the papers used for the 1872 issue of Mexico. It confirms much information given by an authority on Mexican issues; it also shows that some catalogue information is confusing, if not completely wrong.
While the example chosen for illustration was a Mexican issue, many countries such as Brazil (to name but one) have issued stamps on several papers with several watermarks. Measurement might make useful discoveries in unexpected places.
In any case, how thick is ‘thick’? And how thin is ‘thin’? We should get quantitative answers to such questions. How would you feel about perforations if they were described as ‘small’ or ‘large’ instead of being measured to a one-half or one-quarter perforation in two centimeters?},

	abstract = {Subtle variations in ink color and paper of postage stamps can affect their value and desirability to collectors and investors. PIXE has been utilized since the mid-1980s in studies of the ink and paper used for printing of postage stamps. Almquist (1985) utilized PIXE to analyze the color of blue to green lines on 1887 Mexican Numerals stamps, revealing color variations related to metal content of the inks. The 15-centavo Mexico Mail Transportation stamps of 1895- 1898 (“Mulitas”) were printed in similarly varying colors from blue to green, and believed to be from the same ink type. External
beam PIXE milliprobe was used to analyze the paper and ink of examples of the Mulitas stamps to investigate whether the same printing variations would be revealed. Strong differences between the two stamp designs and color shades were noted. The Mulitas papers were relatively devoid of the inorganic fillers and binders used in the Numerals paper. Unlike the Numerals stamps, the Mulitas ink was shown to be primarily organic (indicating an extremely early use of non-metallic ink in postage
stamp printing) with minor amounts of metals including titanium, zinc, vanadium and lead. Color variations between greenish and bluish are related to zinc and titanium content, with more zinc in the first, bluish printing and more titanium in the last, greenish printing. Different batches of pigment appear to have been used for each printing, with color differences related to the presence of sulfur compounds and the addition of whitening agents.},

	abstract = {Subtle variations in ink color and paper of postage stamps can affect their value and desirability to collectors and investors. Proton-induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE) is a generally nondestructive forensic analysis tool that reveals the concentrations of chemical elements in a sample. PIXE has been used for more than 30 years, sometimes in conjunction with other analytical methods, to differentiate philatelic printing techniques; to quantify differences between different shades, varieties, and reprints of stamps; and to separate genuine stamps from forgeries. This paper reviews the history of philatelic paper and ink analysis by PIXE through a focus on case studies from the 1980s to the present. For example, PIXE has been used to show distinct chemical signatures between genuine stamps from China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Silesia, South Africa, South-West Africa, and Taiwan and forgeries thereof. PIXE analysis showed how variations in ink chemistry control color shades of stamps from Mexico and reveal the origin (country of printing) of Iranian stamps, suggesting early (pre-twentieth century) utilization of organic inks on European-printed stamps from both nations. The technique was utilized to determine variations in paper types on stamps from China and Taiwan and how original People’s Republic of China stamps from the early 1950s can be separated from modern reprints. The paper concludes with a PIXE investigation of Mexico’s 1895–1898 “Mulitas” stamps. The analysis reveals that unlike previous Mexican issues, the Mulitas were printed with organic-based inks on largely clay-free
papers. Differing amounts and/or formulations of metal (zinc, lead, and titanium) oxide whiteners apparently controlled the present-day color shade of the stamps, either directly or indirectly, with bluish inks having relatively more zinc and lead and greenish inks having relatively more titanium.},

Possessions belonging to Great Britain, but at present disputed, are all islands and territories lying between longitudes 20°and 50° W., south of latitudes 58° S. The islands enclosed by these boundaries are Dependencies of the Falkland Islands consisting of many islands and part the Antartic Continent. South Georgia, the South Orkney Islands, Graham Land, the South Shetland Islands, the South Sandwich Islands, Alexander I Land and part of Coats Land lie within this area, which amounts in all to about three million square miles, and the territories, portions of which are as yet unexplored, extend down to the South Pole. Great Britain permanently occupies the Dependencies, carrying on a whaling industry and scientific research. In addition the Argentine Government has a meteorological station on Laurie Island in the South Orkneys. This was established in 1904 at the request of Dr W. S. Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, who had built the station two years earlier. Since 1904 it has been continually manned by meteorologists sent out each year from Argentina. The original party had a post office, the first to appear in Antarctica. This and the more recent ones set up under British administration are marked on the accompanying map. Owing to the impermanence of the population of this part of the world they are naturally not all open continuously.},

Blue particles dispersed between the paper fibres of the stamps and present as optical brighteners were identified to be lazurite or the synthetic equivalent, ultramarine blue. Each cancellation or postmark, where present, is composed of carbon, vermilion, iron(III) oxide or a madder-like organic pigment. The Raman analysis also showed that microscopic repair work on stamps can be identified. The genuine stamps were
compared with 13 forged HawaiianMissionary stamps, printed in the early 20th century, and with a set of eight reproduction items printed in 1985, from the Royal Philatelic Society London. Raman analysis of the forged stamps showed that the ink used is different from that of the genuine stamps, being a mixture of Prussian blue and ultramarine blue, or an organic blue pigment. Analysis of the 1985 reproduction stamps
showed that they were printed with modern phthalocyanine blue ink, on paper coated with a yellow organic pigment to simulate aged paper. This analysis provides an invaluable and non-destructive method for assisting in drawing a distinction between fraudulent or reproduction material and the genuine article.},

The number of printed stamps was around 1300million, and it is believed that around 4000 stamps were printed with colour error, but less than 100 stamps are known to have survived. The official colour of the 15 cents stamp was chestnut-brown violet, but due to the long period of time in which this stamp was used and due to the different printings, the differences in colour are common. All the stamps with colour error considered in this study present the same philatelic and printing technical characteristics as the standard stamps, but with chestnut-brown orange or yellow shades. As a result of the scientific analysis, the differences of the colour lie only in the use of different kinds of inks. The nature of the inks as well as the way this error happened is discussed, discarding the presence of fakes or forgeries in the stamps analysed.},

This was found from a comparison with historical samples of mauveine, from both William Perkin and a Heinrich Caro sample (here analysed for the first time). These have distinctly different compositions and this was used to identify the origin of mauveine in the postage stamps, with evidence found for mauveine made by both Perkin’s and Caro’s synthesis.Victorian dyes: Lilac postage stamps of the Victorian period have been analyzed and compared with historical samples of mauveine from W.

Micro- and macro-accessories were compared in both transmission and reflection mode. The best spectra were obtained using a microscope with a diamond cell coupled to an infrared spectrometer. In this case, the extraction of a single paper fibre was enough to obtain a good spectrum. Calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, lead chromate, cyano compounds, cellulose, and oil were identified. When bigger surfaces need to be analyzed, diffuse reflection or variable specular reflectance accessories can be used. Nevertheless, only cyano compounds and calcium carbonate can be characterized. Results are in agreement with those obtained using scanning electron microscopy. The chronological order of the 71 stamps studied showed that the chemical composition of the red ink changed during the period studied.},

Crossing 150 years of issues from the unification of Italy until today, a time line of the major components constituting the stamps has been defined, based on the wide spectral database built on the basis of the numerous analyzed exemplars. Even though it is easy to find reports about stamps’ issues history, information arising from these investigations contributes to throw light upon the substances incorporated in the stamps, which could be described as hybrid or composite materials (a sort of undisclosed or hidden story). As a result of the whole spectra acquired in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode, changes in paper composition showed the transition from the protein sizing glue to starch sizing; also the employment of kaolin varied through time. First it was used as the extender in the pigment−medium mixture, and finally it constituted the coating on the stamp surface. Also the chemical composition of the adhesive gum on the rear side of stamps has been subjected to modifications, as
well as the front side. The earliest back glue was a protein-based adhesive; then it was replaced by gum arabic first and by poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAC) later. FT-IR spectroscopy, supported by the detailed database developed, has been applied, for the first time, in the very useful detection of two counterfeit samples: a fake of the famous Gronchi Rosa, issued in 1961, and a regummed 2 cent red stamp, issued in 1865. The information held in the whole spectral data has been selected and employed in the principal component analysis (PCA) statistical analysis.},

Two Egyptian historical postage stamps printed in blue and red printing inks were evaluated and examined for their composition using a light microscope, SEM-EDS, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopic analyses. Mechanical, chemical, and deacidification
treatments were done for the two stamps. Model stamps were made from the cotton pulp in the book house to simulate historical stamp paper with an average thickness of 11 microns. +e unprinted and printed paper samples with printing inks that aged and
unaged were treated with 0.7\% Klucel G, 0.2\% TiO2 NP, or a mixture of 0.7\% Klucel G + 0.2\% TiO2 NP, and the color change was measured and compared with the blank samples. +etwo stamps are suffering from high pH, where the margin color of the stamps
changed to yellow-brown with weakness of the stamp paper. By SEM examination, stamps have suffered from fibers’ weakness and dryness resulting from the self-oxidation reactions. EDS elemental composition of the red stamp showed the presence of C, O, Na,
Al, Si, Mg, S, Ca, Ba, and Fe, while in the blue stamp, it was C, O, Na, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, and Ca. Raman spectrometer wavelengths turn out that the blueprinting ink of the stamp was characterized with spectra of ultramarine blue (lazurite), while hematite was
characterized by the red stamp. FTIR analysis for the printing inks identified that gum Arabic sample and linseed oil were the binding and color medium, respectively. From the model trials, it was observed that the treatment of a mixture of Klucel G and
TiO2 NP had the best properties for the consolidation of stamps. +e two historical stamps were documented through different spectroscopic analyses, and from the restoration trials, it was observed that the mixture of 7\% Klucel G + 0.2\% TiO2 NP appeared
to be a new and effective method for recovering the historical postage stamps.},

	abstract = {The synthetic dye industry emerged during 1858-60, following the discovery of Perkin's mauve (aniline purple), and Verguin's aniline red (magenta, or fuchsine).l The introduction of these aniline colours posed a special problem in that they did not readily take to cotton fabrics. The problem had, to a considerable extent, been overcome during the early 1860s, as was demonstrated in the displays of dyes and dyed and printed goods at the London
International Exhibition of 1862. Barely had the European synthetic dye industry become established, however, when it was threatened by events across the Atlantic Ocean. The American CivilWar precipitated a cotton famine that was to last from 1862 until 1866, a famine that severely reduced the output of major centres of cotton, or calico, printing. No region was hurt more than Lancashire. In an effort to find a new market for aniline dyes, the leading Lancashire dye manufacturer, Roberts, Dale \& Co., of Manchester, began to
investigate openings in paper printing. The difficulties confronted in this application were to prove no less formidable than for textile printing. Indeed, in some respects they were more problematic since, unlike the situation for textile dyeing and printing, dye-manufacturers had no specialist knowledge of paper printing. That the problems were overcome by the mid 1860s was due in no small part to the efforts of the chemists Heinrich Caro, at Roberts, Dale \& Co., and Hugo Muller, at the London printing company of Thomas De La Rue \& Co. Perhaps the most novel application of synthetic dyes that arose from their working together was in security printing, especially of postage stamps.
This encouraged the conversion of dyes into high quality lakes and pigments.},

	abstract = {The analysis of postage stamps, in particular of pioneer samples, has been an object of some studies, however the nature of the pigments or dyes used to print the first Portuguese postage stamps remain unknown until today. Furthermore, the lack of studies on the materials used for their production, there is also a complete absence of reference to the dyes used to colour these specimens. A mention to the fact that on April 23, 1853, the Portuguese Coin House received a box with paints suggests some similarities between these and the British postage stamps.From a previous analysis some postage stamps of the United Kingdom it is known that Carminic Acid, cochineal, (for reds) and the iconic mauveine (for lilacs / purple) were used in them in the period from 1847 to 1901. In this work, a study has been made of the inks used for red, rose, purple and orange colours in a selected number of Portuguese postage stamps from the period 1857-1909. This is based on the analysis involving a variety of techniques (X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography - diode array detection - mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS), steady and time resolved fluorescence). It was found that the inks included, among others, the inorganic pigments cinnabar (HgS), lead oxide (Pb3O4), lead chromate (PbCrO4), lead sulfide (PbS), and the organic compounds Carminic Acid and Eosin Y. This work demonstrated non-destructive analysis methods for identification of some molecules of colour involving the XRF (for cinnabar, lead oxide, lead chromate, lead sulfide), the UV-Vis (for Carminic Acid and Eosin Y) and fluorescence spectra, together with quantum yields and lifetimes (for Eosin Y).},

	abstract = {The characterisation of palettes used in manuscript illumination is a hard analytical task, due to value and fragility of the analysed items. Analysis on miniatures must be necessarily non-invasive and fast and requires the use of several techniques since no single technique is able to provide all information needed. In this work a four-step analytical protocol is proposed for non-invasive in situ characterisation of miniature paintings. The protocol allows the identification of coloured materials through the use in sequence of complementary techniques, so as to fully exploit the information given by each instrument. Preliminarily to the instrumental investigations on ancient books and miniatures is the compilation of spectroscopic databases obtained from “standard” samples prepared on parchment, according to recipes described in medieval artistic treatises. The protocol starts with an extensive investigation with UV–visible spectrophotometry in reflectance mode, collecting spectra from all the most significant
painted areas in the manuscript; chemometric classification is then performed on the spectra to highlight areas possibly containing the same materials. The second step involves in-depth inspection of miniatures under optical microscopy that guides the interpretation of reflectance spectra. XRF spectrometry is then performed to characterise pigments and metal layers, to verify the presence of overlapping layers, to identify mordants in lakes and to recognise minor components that may yield information concerning provenance; in addition, chemometric classification can be performed on element concentrations to highlight similar areas. Finally, Raman spectroscopy is used to shed light on the uncertain cases, if still present. Such a procedure offers a wealth of information without causing stress to the manuscripts under analysis.},

In two instances, the ink composition permits the unambiguous identification of stamps whose appearance is identical, and which (until now) have only been differentiated through estimates of the degree of hardness or softness of the stamp paper, or through the presence or absence of a watermark in the paper. In these instances, the use of ATR Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectroscopy effectively renders irrelevant two 100-year-old practices of stamp identification. Furthermore, since the use of ATR sampling makes it possible to obtain the spectrum of a stamp still attached to its cover, it is no longer necessary to identify these blue Franklin stamps using their cancellation dates.},

	title = {The use of barium sulfate in printing inks as filler material},
	url = {http://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/38070},
	abstract = {Blanc fixe is a transparent pigment made from barium sulfate. It is used in inks as a filler pigment and its main function in inks is to replace partly the need of the most expensive part of ink, coloured pigment, and hence reduce the cost of the ink.
The purpose of the study was to produce knowledge for the client about inks in general and their properties in printing technology. Also, it was to untangle how the properties of sheet-fed offset inks change when pigment is replaced by Banc fixe filler. Pigment material was replaced in such a manner that the filler content in ink was 4, 8 and 12 weight percent. The pigments studied were two different grades of Blanc fixe and a competitive filler. Also, ink without any additive filler was tested to produce the reference values.
Inks were tested by printing strips on an IGT-printability tester after which the ink amount on the paper was calculated. From the printed strips, densities of un-touched, set-off and print through areas as well as gloss and colour-values were measured. Results of measurements were tabulated and trend curves for different determinations were constructed from them. Following, ink requirement, set-off, print through, gloss, colour-values and colour differences were calculated in the target density.
The most essential conclusion was that against the results of this study, the Blanc Fixe filler pigments of the client’s repertoire are possible to use in sheet-fed offset inks so that the total cost of the ink can be reduced without affecting crucially to the properties of an ink film. Some declination was perceived in commensurate to the increase in filler content. However, for example decrease in absolute values of gloss and increase in colour differences were tolerable. All things considered, the best performers were the competitive filler and the Blanc Fixe product with smaller particle size. Results of this study are intend-ed to be suggestive and as a result the client had a positive indicator for the continuance on the study on Blanc fixe products used as ink fillers.},

	abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies were performed on the margins (the area without printed colors) of a set of German postage stamps dated 1923 and corresponding to the hyperinflationary period of economy.SEM results showed the presence of Al, Si, Zn and S in the samples, but in different combinations. Sulfur is considered to be a contaminant. The Al-Si combination is credited to kaolinite, Zn to ZnO and unaccompanied Al possibly to Al2O3. Several experimental IR bands of kaolinite agree with the suggestion of its existence in some stamps. In the case of Al and Zn alone we have supposed that, with the passing of time and with the help of moisture, AlOH and ZnOH were formed in a quantity allowing detecting some of the metal-OH bands by IR spectroscopy. On the basis of previous infrared experimental results on Al and Zn hydroxides we assigned some IR bands to the OH groups bonded to these metals. Our results indicate that it is highly probable that the paper used to print these postage stamps was originated in more than one paper mill.},

The resulting Raman spectra are not of enough quality allowing a direct interpretation. Possible corrections to these spectra are, for example, the removal of the background fluorescence, the baseline correction and/or smooth. These tools are available in several spectroscopy software packages. The central question is the reliability of the spectra obtained after one or more corrections are applied. In order to begin creating a common procedure to treat all samples we ascribed only those bands that coincide with the cellulose calculated Raman frequencies. The first results suggest that it is necessary to carry out more studies with a significant number of samples before proposing a common treatment for all Raman spectra of postage stamps presenting fluorescence.},

	abstract = {Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of various celluloses were measured at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Various spectra recorded in the solid state were compared: (1) ECF bleached papers made of hardwood, the anhydroglucose units of which were chemically modified at C$_{\textrm{1}}$ and C$_{\textrm{6}}$ or C$_{\textrm{2}}$ and C$_{\textrm{3}}$ positions with carboxylic groups; (2) microcrystalline cellulose; (3) cotton linters; and (4) delignified sisal fibers (mercerized or not). Fluorescence emission was quite independent of the carboxylic acid content and average molecular weight (determined by viscosimetry) of the cellulose polymers. Microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel), cotton linters, and mercerized delignified sisal cellulose were acetylated in homogeneous medium (DMAc/LiCl as solvent system) to obtain soluble polymers in dichloromethane for comparison of spectra recorded in the solid and liquid states. Fluorescence of cellulose acetates in solution (CH$_{\textrm{2}}$Cl$_{\textrm{2}}$) and in the solid state was compared under similar experimental conditions to non-esterified celluloses in the solid state. The importance of the solid state for fluorescence emission could be demonstrated. Fluorophores are present in minute amounts in the polymer and their favorable energy transfer for excitation in the solid state likely enhances fluorescence emission. Among numerous fluorophores, dityrosine appeared to be a good candidate for fluorescence because it displayed emission in the fluorescence range of cellulose. Dityrosine is an amino acid involved in the lignification of non-woody plants. Mercerized sisal impregnated with tyrosine in the presence of peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide did not show enhanced emission, in contrast to para-hydroxycinnamic acid (coumaric acid), which is also involved in the lignification process at least for non-woody plants. The origin of cellulose fluorescence remains uncertain and appears to have several origins. This study clearly underlines the importance of the solid state for enhancing fluorophore emission.},

	abstract = {Corrected steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of various mechanical pulps and celluloses were measured using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Regardless of its source, cellulose displayed a relatively high characteristic emission. The emission spectra of mechanical pulps were red-shifted with respect to that of cellulose, and peak shapes were influenced by the pulping process, by hydrogen peroxide bleaching and by monochromatic UV irradiation of the sheets. Changes in emission spectra owing to bleaching or UV irradiation occurred principally in the 370-440 nm and 500-550 nm regions, and were similar to changes in reflectance spectra reported in the literature. This suggests that, to a first approximation, emission spectra of mechanical pulps may be interpreted as a decrease in emission of cellulose caused by light absorption by lignin; changes due to bleaching and irradiation may be attributed to changes in lignin absorption.},

were used. The examinations showed that inks and glue on the marks of both values were the same as samples of those sent by the manufacturer.
Discrepancies in some results were observed probably due to contamination, that is, an accidental presence of the foreign substance on the surface (e.g., sweat, saliva while sticking the marks to the surface or physical handling of the documents). It was concluded that there are original (genuine) court tax marks.},

Measurements with XRF are carried out in order to facilitate the analysis of the diffractograms and to point out differences in the elemental composition of different pigments. The creation of a database of the obtained data and diffractograms is in progress. It will be a collection of the most common and interesting pigments used in art.

	abstract = {Drylands of Ethiopia, including those in the Rift Valley, host good potential for commercial production of natural gums such as gum arabic. However, little researches have assessed the qualities of these gums for their commercial and industrial promotions. The objectives of this study were to assess the (i) quality of gum arabic collected from naturally grown Acacia senegal trees in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia and (ii) evaluate these quality characteristics against reported quality attributes of the same kind of gum from known
destinations such as the Sudan and with international specifications. Gum samples were collected from randomly identified 10 trees of A. senegal in the study area and composited into one big sample by putting all in one plastic bag. The characteristics analyzed included: color, odor, moisture content, ash content, viscosity, pH, specific rotation, N and tannin contents, and concentration of several metals using standard laboratory procedures. The results yielded moisture content of 15\%, ash content of 3.56\%, intrinsic viscosity of 1.19 ml g1, pH on 25\% solution of 4.04, specific rotation of 32.5, nitrogen content of 0.35\%, protein content of 2.31\% and with no tannin content. Mineral contents of the gum arabic (g/100 g) are Ca 0.7, Mg 0.2, Na 0.01, K 0.95, Fe 0.001, P 0.6 and non-detectable traces of Pb, Co, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd, Cr and Mn. These values agree well with values of same quality characteristics of gum arabic reported from Sudan and other exporting countries, and also conform well to international standards in all aspects. Indeed, it is possible to utilize the gum arabic resource of the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia for commercial and/or industrial purposes.},

From a historical standpoint, numerous chemists and a variety of chemical discoveries have been depicted on postage stamps (1). A variety of man-made chemicals have found
their way into the production of postage stamps: dyes and pigments, phosphors, and polyvinyl adhesives. The colors of various dyes and pigments can be elucidated by an understanding of ligand field theory, charge transfer, molecular orbital theory, and band theory. The fluorescent and phosphorescent properties of certain compounds have been used in the paper and ink used to produce stamps. The production of adhesives such as dextrin and polyvinyl alcohol often involves acid hydrolysis, polymerization and the use of preservatives and flavoring agents. In brief, a wealth of chemical theory and technology is incorporated in the production of modern postage stamps.},

	abstract = {What can there be about a 20th century definitive issue of Haiti that would make it of special interest? What could be more mundane than a series of seven stamps that first appeared in late 1933 and were the principal stamps in use for the next nine years? If it were also observed that the stamps were designed and printed by the very reliable American Bank Note Company and that no errors are known to exist, why write
about the issue for a publication of philatelic record? 
To this author the answer lies in the fact that catalogue listings of the series Eire incomplete and, in some instances, incorrect. Further, there are interesting artists' sketches, progress and "For Approval" proofs, and completed die proofs that are unreported and deserve to be chronicled. Finally, there are a few missing facts about the series that perhaps can be provided by other collectors who may peruse these lines.},

It argues that Britain’s role as guardian of the Persian Gulf, beginning in 1835, was not imposed coercively, that Britain largely conformed to local expectations of a protector’s duties and rights, and that its record in Eastern Arabia was far better than its record elsewhere in the Middle East. It begins with an overview of regional insecurity before the Pax Britannica. It then examines why Britain came to defend Eastern Arabia and the advantages and disadvantages that entailed for the local rulers. It explains the legal status of the Gulf shaikhdoms and Oman resulting from their treaties with Britain and their close relationship with the British Empire. It also discusses Britain’s post-war attempts to develop these states, the nature of Anglo–American relations in the region, and the
growing challenges to Britain’s position in Eastern Arabia in the 1950s–60s.
It provides a new account of Britain’s withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, showing how Britain introduced defense arrangements that remain in place forty years on. It finishes with a reflection on Britain’s legacy in the Gulf today.},

	abstract = {The history of philately (the study of postage stamps) shows a gradual increase in the use of color in the inks used to produce postage stamps. Low chroma reds and brown were introduced through the use of natural plant dyes, such as indigo and animal dyes. Today, many synthetic organic dyes and pigments produce much stronger stamp colors. This paper presents a table that lists the various dyes and pigments that are currently being used by the U.S. Postal Service for the printing of postage stamps. A section on the origins of color includes a discussion of the molecular and atomic composition of various dyes and pigments. A section on luminescence notes that the luminescent properties of certain papers and inks have been used in two important philatelic applications. The first application is the use of phosphors on the surfaces of stamps, so that facer/canceler machines can locate and cancel the stamps. Phosphors are materials that give off visible light when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Another philatelic application is in the detection of fakes and forgeries. Since ultraviolet will reveal many differences in materials not seen in visible light, it can often be used to detect repairs, alterations, and forgeries. The paper concludes with a discussion of types of adhesives used in postage stamps, with attention to the three adhesives used in U.S. postage stamps: gun arabic, dextrin, and polyvinyl alcohol. 9 figures, 3 tables, and 11 references},

Changes in the pigments used at different times have been invaluable in detecting incongruities that suggest fraud, but relatively little work has been published that uses the chemical changes in oil binders as they dry to determine when an ink print or an oil painting was made. Using attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy and samples with known dates, we calibrate the drying of
oil binders in inks and paints and cross-validate the paints with pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS).
We apply the ink calibration to a case study involving the age determination of possible philatelic counterfeits from a World War II Jewish Ghetto in Occupied Poland, obtaining a date of 1946 +/-6 (1s, n = 9) for the genuine stamps, and 1963 +/-16 (1 s, n = 19) for the various reproductions.},

Also analyzed in detail 30 editions of the Brazilian Stamps Catalog published between 1975 and 2018. As first considerations, considering the time scope analyzed, the catalog suffered significant editorial transformations, continuous improvement of thematic categories, and it continued to insert new philatelic documents, finally, data referenced to the production of commemorative postage stamps issued between 1900 and 1943 were studied. The provisional results and the ongoing research provokes an interesting opportunity to debate about philatelic documentation and its practice of

It seeks, furthermore, to determine if private enterprise in the postal sector is absolutely inpracticable in Brazil’s present juridical order, and identify whether the restrictions or complete hindrance of private interaction in this area have legal nature, coming form Law 6.538 itself, or constitutional nature, drawing from Brazil’s very Constitution.},

This methodology is based on two procedures. The first performs precise easurements
of the dimensions of overprints and a statistical analysis of the minor variations present
among them. The second performs a colorimetric analysis of the ink used for printing
the overprints. The goal is to determine if these methods can differentiate between overprints made by different printers and if they can allow rapid identification of counterfeit overprints. A set of overprinted stamps from post–World War I Hungary was selected for testing samples. These stamps had many varieties, were produced by two different print shops, and were often counterfeited. After describing the different scientific testing performed, this paper outlines general procedures that may be used by other researchers.},

	copyright = {The Royal Philatelic Society London},
	isbn = {978-1-913015-09-1},
	abstract = {Identification of bank notes, stamps or postal stationery is primarily by colour, as are labels for grocery products, railway tickets, or other paper ephemera. Obviously, printing on them may spell out their denominations or reasons to exist, but it is colour that the eyes identify first. But that is determined by the inks used which, in turn, are determined by their ingredients and recipes. Yet the subject of inks has been the least studied aspects in printing history despite some shades of colour being more eagerly sought by collectors than others. 
The book starts with a general outline of printing in the second half of the century to provide an insight into the innovative methods and techniques of the De La Rue company, and puts their use of synthetic dyestuffs into context. Ink production by the company is then considered, especially their development of pigments from dyes, and how they used additives, paper, printing presses and plates. Discussion follows of the recipe ledgers, of their colour trials and samples, stability experiments and fading, their postmarking inks for the Post Office, and of fluorescence or ‘bleeding’ of their aniline inks. Finally, a gazetteer, an index of the ingredients and an extensive general index aid collectors. The second half of the book, though, details the recipes, ingredients, varnishes or oils, quantities and ink-makers comments of nearly 2500 inks and as such makes the book a notable work of reference.
This, then, is the first study to consider De La Rue \& Co.’s inks in detail, and their choice and application from an historical, scientific, economical, and manufacturing point of view, and uncovers their ‘secret’ ingredients – especially for their Unique Selling Point, their Fugitive inks. It should appeal to both philatelists, notaphilists , or collectors of ephemera, as well as printers and social historians wanting to know more about printed products in previous ages.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopy has long been a popular subject with respect to postal stamps, but analysis of postal stamps has been the subject of only a few spectroscopic studies. Fourier transform infrared techniques were used in developing a nondestructive technique to analyze the adhesives on the back of stamps. This factor is of importance since the value of a stamp is partially dependent on the conditions of the original adhesive. Diffuse reflectance was finally settled on as the method of choice for this analysis, and it shows great promise not only for stamp analysis but also for other types of documentation analysis as well.},

The Spanish Monarchy, under the  paradigm of the Bourbon Reforms, promoted a  project to reform the Spanish-American mail in the second half of the 18th century with the aim of making overseas communications more organized and regular. However, these plans for renewal came up against limits and power struggles between different agents interested in the circulation of information. This is reflected in the postal administration of Cartagena de Indias, which was a fundamental nucleus for the Crown where the interests of the different local and global powers converged, and where the difficulty of dominating the Spanish empire can be seen. This article analyses the contradictions and discrepancies of the postal reform  project, examining it in a polycentric key through the communications node of the city of Cartagena de Indias.},

This resulted in a series of institutional changes to take control of the written communication channels within the empire. This, the new postal regulations fell on several colonial officials (“administradores, subalternos y tenientes de correo”) who had the duty to dispatch of letters at regional, vice royal and imperial levels. The present article seeks to understand the experience and practices generated by the expansion of the absolutist state illustrated on the communicative dimension of the empire in the Colonial Chilean government. From the analysis of the files of the Administradora General de Correos de Chile – both in the Archivo Nacional Histórico de Chile and in Archivo de Indias in Seville – we understand that these subordinates allowed, through negotiations and conflicts, the integration and political communication of the territory from Santiago to the internal provinces, and from these to Madrid.

The paper explores the establishment of an extensive communication circuit between Seville, Madrid, Lima, Mexico, Guatemala and other cities, and interrogates how the actions of officially-appointed Correos Mayores, their lieutenants, and other agents acted as communicative poles that enabled the distribution of correspondence across the globe. The model become highly perfectible and included the widespread employment of non-officials, a facet that Castilian monarchs never sanctioned as an illegal practice. The paper argues that from the 16th century onwards, "American" versions of royal concessions of the Correo Mayor became a strategy to confront and solve the vast distance that resulted from Europe's connection with the "enormous" New World (and vice versa).},

To understand this system's rationale I focus on the figure of the correos mayores, who were responsible for the distribution of official information (or information of interest to the crown) within certain Spanish American cities. Using sources in American and European archives, I question the premise that Spanish American communication was chaotic during this period. I also argue that the exceptional circulation of mail within Spanish America and overseas during the sixteenth century is essential for understanding European expansion and the early modern world.},

This article examines the project of reform of the postal system that the Bourbon onarchy planned from 1764 through 1765. The article shows how these projects of the reform, especially the postal system, had resistances not only in Peninsula but also in the Latin American territories.

The Hispanic monarchy, under the paradigm of the Bourbon reforms, promoted a project to reform the Hispanic American mail with the aim of making overseas communications more organized and regular. However, these renewal plans encountered limits and power struggles between different agents interested in the circulation of information. This is reflected in the Cartagena de Indias postal administration, which was a fundamental nucleus for the Crown, where strategies and interests of the different local and global powers converged, forming a polyhedral reality of postal communication. This doctoral thesis analyzes the role of the post office reform project in the sociopolitical, economic and administrative planes of the Bourbon Crown in the 18th century, having as object of study the specific case of implementation in the post office administration of Cartagena de Indias. In this research, this postal agency is analyzed from a historical and diplomatic point of view, demonstrating that this institution had its own agency, constituting one of the main tools of power that molded empires and a document-producing body that reflects the close relationship between government and information, that is, between empire and communication.},

and collateral historical material bearing upon the postal services in and to the area now comprising the Republic of Ecuador, from earliest Colonial times, through 1864. It is promised that, with the completion of this trilogy of articles, the author will not again allow type to be set to paper upon this obviously introverted subject.
The material for consideration in this article includes volumes of laws promulgated by the various Monarchs of Spain, beginning in the Kith Century; certain historical reports bearing upon the colonial mail services within the Audiencia of Quito, the territorial forerunner of Ecuador; and finally, laws of the Ecuadorean Congress, and decrees and circular instructions of the Presidents of Ecuador, from 1830, the date Ecuador achieved its sole independence, to the end of 1864, when the first adhesive postage stamps were contracted for.},

These translations are offered as an aid to postal historians and philatelists interested in the postal service and the stamps of the Republic of Peru. The whereabouts of certain copies of "Coleccion Postale" are known but access is not generally available. For those who might be interested, a copy is said to exist in the Postal .Museum in Lima, Peru; another copy is in the library of the Pan American Union in Washington, D. C.; another is in the library of the Royal Philatelic Society in London, England, and a copy is possessed by the
writer of these lines. A philatelic auction house in Miami, Florida offered a copy during the spring of 1970. To the best of our knowledge it was not sold, hence reverted back to the owner, whose name we do not know. For all we know other copies may exist elsewhere but we know nothing about them.},

	abstract = {Early trans-Pacific mail has an overwhelming attraction for me. The rarity of such letters
is one, but not the only, reason. In the many years I have been collecting, I have amassed a grand total of four letters from or to the West Coast of South America. The sheer, raw courage of the ancient mariners who challenged the vast expanse of an ocean frequently anything but pacific, in cockleshells of a few hundred tons, navigating by unknown constellations to a strange coast or tiny specks of land in the watery vastness, is
the stuff legends are made of.
An added challenge for the student is the lack of packet services and, therefore, of an organized mail service. Letters were carried "by favour" on merchant ships, so research into the ways and means by which these letters reached their destinations is totally different from the study of shipping lines, schedules and rates. It boils down to the
ships, their nationalities, their departure and arrival dates and, in some cases, their connections with other ships. How I analyzed the voyage of a letter from Macao to Santiago de Chile forms the major part of this narrative. My means and methods might be of interest and possible use to students embarking on similar projects and are, therefore, described
in detail.},

America occasionally and were greeted with great enthusiasm, but commercial use was
somewhat limited. International politics prevented potentially large operations by airlines
like Pan American Airways and Deutsche Lufthansa from starting out when and where these companies might have liked. And the distances were much greater: the  development of aircraft that could carry a payload over such an expanse took some time. As with the South Atlantic, the various operations were not truly independent.

	copyright = {Heinrich Köhler Auktionshaus GmbH \& Co. KG Corinphila Auktionen AG},
	abstract = {Among Brazil's most popular early stamps are the three issues of the so-called large Dom Pedro series of stamps, which appeared in 1866-1878. These issues replaced the previous so-called bull's-, goat's- and cat's-eye issues. The portrait of Emperor Dom Pedro was now the design that the American Bank Note Company produced by steel engraving in many different values. The issues are still among the most beautiful designs that Brazil has ever issued. They were collected by many enthusiasts in the past, especially as a wide variety of "dumb" and local postmarks of Brazil - which are quite affordable in good condition - could easily be collected on the stamps.

But anyone who hears the name of the collector Pablo Reim (b. 23 June 1955) of Buenos Aires knows that this well-known philatelist prefers and appreciates the special, the unusual. In addition to his home country of Argentina, he has several Brazil collections of outstanding quality. This specialised Dom Pedro collection is also an example of what competence, knowledge and many a lucky acquisition of rarities can bring about.

The collection, which is described throughout in English, is a traditional collection of its type. This means that it is dedicated in a specialised way to the stamps themselves, for which essays and proofs, then the stamps themselves, and finally their usage on cover are presented. As if this were a simple challenge, Reim has tried to put together for each value what was truly unusual: the largest known multiples and rarest letter frankings with some very unusual destinations and postage rates. He has succeeded in doing this very well and thus the reader finds many items of exquisite rarity and quality in pristine condition. The descriptions are kept short, but always provide the correct explanation for weight steps and postage for usages on cover. The collector of these issues will probably have his heart set on them, because he has probably never seen so many such things before. And if he has, then only in many auction catalogues of recent decades. In this book he gets such a comprehensive and concentrated view of these charming issues as is only rarely possible.},

	abstract = {Reim deals with the subject in ten "chapters", beginning with the "First Contract" up to the sixth printing order (1883 ff.). Included are the provisionals of 1877 and 1882, which ecame necessary because changes in postage rates resulted in a shortage of stamps and made it necessary to overprint stamps in the country. Reim follows this chronology in the traditional way of collecting that is typical of him. The stamps, their essays and/or proofs are at the beginning of each new issue. This is followed by the presentation of some of the largest known multiples in unused and used condition. Then follows a series of usages of the stamps of each value on cover - from single frankings to multiple- and mixed frankings. Postage rates and postage overviews are explained in each case. Even mixed frankings with other issues (such as with the preceding Rivadavia issue) and bisects are among the rarities that can be seen in this book in perfect condition and in large numbers. The variety seems inexhaustible, but notes such as "only three covers known" quickly make it clear to the reader that the material shown is anything but an everyday commodity.},

	title = {The “{Art} of {Sperati}” {Collection}: {The} {Most} {Famous} {Stamp} {Forger} in the {World}},
	copyright = {David Feldman SA},
	url = {https://www.davidfeldman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Catalogue_stamps_Sperati_December2022.pdf},
	abstract = {Jean de Sperati (1884 to 1957) without doubt created, with his own hands, the greatest
ever collection of classic stamp forgeries ever seen. To many in the philatelic world he is
the ultimate stamp imitator, to others his creations are revered as the most dangerous of all adhesive reproductions.

It therefore gives us enormous pleasure to present to you a unique and historical offering
of the material used by Sperati to create his incredible reproductions. The "Art of Sperati”
collection includes 136 lots of different levels of complexity and richness, many of which
comprise previously unrecorded material, as well as unknown working reproductions.
The collection contains the most significant selection of never-before-seen ‘master matrices’, ‘glass support clichés', ‘clichés on celluloid’, ‘copper plates’ as well as ‘working proofs’. 

In 1953 Sperati sold an archive of his work to the British Philatelic Association (BPA), which
with Robson Lowe, one of Sperati’s greatest admirers of the time, produced books in 1955
as an aid to the philatelic community to understand how better to detect his replicas. One of the most famous of all forgery experts, collector Carl Walske (1922-2009), also in partnership with Lowe, authored ‘The Work of Jean de Sperati II, including Previously Unlisted Forgeries’, which was published in 2001. Until now, no other substantial work, or new discoveries have been published or offered for sale on the scale seen in this auction.

The auction begins with the document that was seized by the French Customs in 1942
(and later returned to Sperati) as evidence in a trial that exposed to the world the work and
genius of this exceptional artist. Among the highlights in the auction are undiscovered Sperati works, including attempts to reproduce the Mauritius 1847 “Post Office” issues and the Great Britain 1840 “VR” Penny Black. We also present his last artwork, made a few months before his death, the Canada 1859 Jacques Cartier 17c. Throughout the sale, in addition to the many unique items from known Sperati reproductions such as the Treskilling Yellow, are a considerable number of clichés or negative masters which were unpublished and unknown to the BPA. The auction concludes with various ancillary items, including his iconic binocular glasses.

It is important to mention that forgeries are consider as appropriate by the International
Federation of Philately (F.I.P.), as a material of comparison with the genuinely issued stamps.

Therefore, exhibitors will also be able to enrich their collections with precious historical items from Sperati.

This sale embodies a wonderful combination of visually impressive material, fascinating
new discoveries, and a wonderful source for research.},

1-Should a Philatelic Index sponsored by the A. P. S., attempt to embrace all
Philatelic Literature in all languages?
2-If so, should each country co-operate by indexing all material of its language?
3-Should it cover American publications only, or all in the English language?
4-If all in the English language, should this society work alone, or in co-operation
with British societies?
5-Should all Philatelic publications be listed? If not, which should be used?
6-Should all articles in publications be listed? If not, which should be used?
7-Should material be cross indexed by both authors and subjects?
8-Should new issue chronicles be listed?
9-Should re-published articles be listed?
10-Should such a publication be published in sections, each section forming a
volume, covering the literature of a period of years, and by such a system
made perpetual?},

The stamp itself is a favorite with collectors of Argentinian stamps, as it is certainly a masterpiece in miniature, albeit with a rather crowded design. But this new material is thus far a puzzle in that its exact status is not apparent, nor can we find any mention of it in any literature.
A thorough search has been made thru philatelic journals of 1902, but absolutely
no mention is made of the items in question. This brief article is published
in the hope that some of our readers may be familiar with the facts surrounding
these items.},

The first dismissal affects Mariano Silvero, in 1801 during Colony, by order of the Villa Rica Postmaster; the second change hurts Francisco Aranda by order of the commander of San Pedro, in 1819, in the Francia’s Government, and the third case involves Jose Tomas Garcia who maintained a question with the district commander, in the first Constitutional Government.},

While the dies are described as being American Bank Note Co. dies, a number are actually from the Hamilton Bank Note Co.
How did the Hamilton dies become ABNC dies? It is a tale of mergers and acquisitions. The
Security Banknote Co, was founded in 1884, and acquired the Hamilton Bank Note engraved plates in 1951 (Hamilton was liquidated in 1948). In 1957 the Security Banknote Co and Columbian Banknote Co consolidated to form the Security-Columbian Banknote Co. They changed the name to United States Banknote Corp (USBN) in 1965. This Company acquired ABNC in 1990. Thus, the ABNC dies and Hamilton dies were brought together.},

In this way, it will be possible to establish an overview of the contribution of stamps in order to assess and determine how effective this tax is in Colombia? With the purpose of answering this question, the problems that the tribute has from the moment of its creation are evidenced, such as the large number of purposes that are imposed on it or the lack of strict control by the Government. Finally, a series of necessary adjustments are indicated to make this tax tool impact more efficiently in the territorial entities and help to respond to the challenges facing the development of the country.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive and detailed account of a hitherto unacknowledged, initially clandestine wartime air route flying “The Wrong Way” around the Atlantic Ocean. Pan American Airways, with limited aircraft resources performed a huge logistical task with astonishing efficiency and resolve. The purpose of their mission was to gain access to the intelligence contained in the flow of mail and material flowing uninterrupted between the Axis powers in Europe and their Axis-leaning spheres of influence in South America. Cooperation in the setting up of a dedicated US/British censorship operation in San Juan, Puerto Rico was key to the intelligence gathering but seldom appreciated until now. That the mission succeeded is indisputable; as the official US Congress Senate Committee Report (22 June 1945) noted:

By this means, British and US Censorship were able to control all airmail between Latin America and Europe. This mail included the highly important airmail between the Argentine on the one hand and Germany and the European neutrals on the other. This was probably the most important channel in the world.

This book tells the story of the mail routes and censorship processes. It has been painstakingly researched from a combination of primary archive sources and empirical evidence from the covers themselves. This is the first time the story has been told fully in a published book.},

	copyright = {Royal Philatelic Society of London},
	isbn = {978-1-913015-13-8},
	abstract = {The intention with this book is to describe the development of the postal routes to Dutch West Africa, Dutch West Indies and Suriname from the time of the earliest currently known letter (1652) until World War I, to describe mail-carrying shipping lines, to document handstamps used to mark this mail and to highlight whether a route is commonly or rarely used.
To avoid duplication of data (contents of issued postal circulars, listings of ships, ship’s schedules etc.) that can be found in published handbooks, these sources are referred to through-out the text to guide those who would like to go deeper into a subject. Many conclusions are based on the author’s own records of individual objects. Frequencies of letters and different types of route handstamps used to mark and direct mail to a specific route and carrier are documented.
The putative and factual existence of sub-types of route markings have been investigated and whether or not the handstamps of these sub-type markings actually came in use is another focus in the book. These markings are also listed separately in a ‘Postmark Catalogue’ (Chapter 6). In addition, a ‘key’ of how to work out the route a specific letter has been transported is provided, i.e. a “guide' to the notations and markings that can be expected to be found on mail forwarded by a specific route or shipping line (Chapter 7).
Finally, the author's ambition has been to support the text with scans of important letters and other postal items sent to or from the Dutch colonies in the Western hemisphere.},

The Colombian-German Air Transport Company (Spanish: Sociedad Colombo Alemana de Transportes Aéreos, German: Deutsch-Kolumbianische Luftverkehrsgesellschaft), or SCADTA, was the world's second airline, and the first airline in the Americas, operating from 1919 until World War IIIn 1919, the victorious Allies after World War I suffocated German aviation. With very few opportunities in Germany, German aviators looked elsewhere. Two young German aviators, pilot Fritz Hammer and engineer Wilhelm Schnurbusch, found their opportunity in Colombia. The SCADTA company was formed in 1919, with Colombian investors, and they ordered two Junkers F 13 planes, which arrived in 1920.The Colombian government cooperated with SCADTA and gave it an exclusive franchise, but not a contract for carrying mail. SCADTA had to collect fees for carrying mail on its own. SCADTA issued its own stamps, which had to be used in addition to regular stamps of the Colombian postal service. These stamps and their use to and from Switzerland are the main subject of this exhibit.Soon mailers in other countries learned of the speed-up in the mail service from Colombia, and wanted to use the SCADTA service too. So SCADTA had to figure out how to sell its stamps overseas. At that time, the international currency market was a mess. SCADTA did not want its stamps used in international currency speculation. So, it overprinted its stamps for use from different countries. It used “EU” (Estados Unidos) for mail from the United States, “F” from France, “A” (Alemana) from Germany, “S” from Switzerland, … The stamps were placed on sale in Colombian consulates in those countries, and thus are called “consular” stamps.In 1932, SCADTA finally got a contract from the Colombian government to carry mail. SCADTA stamps were no longer needed on mail, and were soon invalidated. The contract was apparently negotiated so quickly that Colombia did not have any airmail stamps ready. So, their first airmail stamps were overprinted SCADTA stamps, soon replaced by new designs.The exhibit continues tracing the mail from Colombia to Switzerland until 1940, then tells of the mail from Switzerland to Colombia.},

	abstract = {For empires to effectively manage their colonial possessions they rely on the efficient
and predictable circulation of correspondence between the metropole and periphery.
In the mid to late eighteenth century, Enlightened intellectuals and Spanish
administrators recognized the need to improve the predictability of the exchange and
delivery of the royal mail throughout the empire. The objective included enhancing
maritime transportation between Spain and its American colonies, but, perhaps just
as importantly, within the viceroyalties. This effort emphasized the need to create
a standardized system with regularly scheduled hours to deliver and pick up packages
and exchange official correspondence. Despite this desire, reformers encountered
numerous issues implementing these regulations throughout the Viceroyalty of
Peru. Competing political interests led to internal squabbling over jurisdiction, and
reformers underestimated the new demands that these crown-sponsored mandates
placed on the inhabitants of Peru. An analysis of the efforts to improve the royal
postal service reveals contradictory policies of the Bourbons and illustrates the problems
of top-down reform within the American colonies.},

decision of the Crown to assume the management and control of the mail system, which
brought substantial improvements in the expansion of the routes and reduction of the
travel time, but some flaws and issues were still evident. This work attempts to examine the
obstacles that hindered the proper operation of the postal service in the framework of the
reforms implemented halfway the 18th century by Commissioner Joseph Antonio de Pando, namely: fraud, delays, violations; interceptions; and loss of letters and parcels. These obstacles led to a loss of prestige for the sector, and were an additional sign of the weakening and crisis of the colonial politic – administrative regime.},

The unsatisfactory state of academic attention on the subject has been due in large part to the lack of sources. However, previously unused business archives from German aircraft producer Junkers of Dessau yield a wealth of new information about Scadta's history. Other important primary sources used for this article include material from the German Foreign Office and the Deutsche Luft Hansa. Based on these documents it is possible to carry out for the first time a critical analysis of the origins and development of Scadta. Many of the facts about Scadta's founding, expansion, and subsequent failure are also established.},

The Handbook opens with the story of the people, entities and events that were behind the release of these cards in November 1898. The detailed background information about the Four Series of View Cards, their printings and distribution bring to life the previously unknown background of these important issues in a fascinating story.
In Part 2, the author introduces a detailed Scenic View Card identification numbering system, with color illustrations and individual background listings of all existing Single View Cards.
Next, in Part 3, the author goes on to classify and list all Double Scenic View Cards, providing detailed individual listings and information for each Double View Card, accompanied by color illustrations and cross references to the matching Single View Cards.
This leads in Part 4 into a Master List of Card Views from all Four Series of Cards, followed-up with an individual listing of each of the Four Cards Series and Single and Double Views. In addition, there is are updated, corrected and reclassified separate listings of the First Series Small and LARGE 1899 print settings (similar to how these cards were initially described on January 31, 1899 when first announced).},

	abstract = {The nature of the pigments or dyes used to dye the first Portuguese postage stamps has remained unknown until now. In this work, a study has been made of the inks used for red, rose, purple and orange colors in a selected number of Portuguese postage stamps from the period 1857 to 1909. This is based on analysis involving a variety of techniques (X-ray fluorescence, UV-Vis spectroscopy, HPLC-MS/HPLC-DAD, steady and time resolved fluorescence). It was found that the inks included, among others, the inorganic pigments cinnabar (HgS), lead oxide (Pb 3 O 4 ) and chromate (PbCrO 4 ), lead sulphide (PbS), and the organic compounds carminic acid and Eosin Y. The study demonstrated a non-destructive analysis method for identification of two molecules of color involving the UV-Vis (for carminic acid and Eosin Y) and fluorescence spectra, together with quantum yields and lifetimes (for Eosin Y).},

However, there are no studies focused on the types of paper used, and only vertical laid paper appears as a variety in some catalogs. This manuscript presents the results obtained from the study of weft and thickness attending to the different types of paper used in this issue. It concludes the existence of four types of paper, differentiated by their weft as wove smooth, vertical laid and with dots, while two types of paper with wove smooth can be separated by their thickness. It is possible to consider a fifth type as thick paper, which is only seen in the scarce salmon shade 6 cent stamp. As a second conclusion of this study, the types of paper used in each of the two impressions are presented.},

	abstract = {Professor and media theorist Thomas Levin is dedicated to preserving these sounds of the past. He maintains the world’s only archive dedicated to what he calls the “Phono-Post.” At the height of the phenomenon, there were perhaps thousands of Voice-O-Graph machines in America and many more recording stations across the world. “Millions of these audio letters were sent across the United States, South America, in Europe, in Russia, in China,” Levin says.

The Phono-Post online audio-visual archive represents the first systematic attempt to document an astonishingly important yet surprisingly neglected moment in media history: the practice of sending individually recorded audio messages as acoustic letters via the mail. The product of a multi-year research project directed by Prof. Thomas Y. Levin (Princeton University) at the Friedrich Schlegel Graduate School for Literary Studies at the Freie Universität Berlin, and generously funded by the Einstein Foundation (Berlin), the ongoing endeavor is both amassing and making available to scholars a vast archive of these highly fragile, rapidly disappearing and unique multi-media artefacts.},

	abstract = {We are delighted to announce that we have been appointed to sell by private treaty the fabulous collection “Colonial and Republican Stampless Postal History”, a highly interesting prephilatelic collection of Colombia. It comprises 150 items arranged alphabetically by localities and mounted on exhibition pages, mainly including material originating from the Spanish colonial period, this being scarcer than the Republican period.

The mail routes are indicated for the colonial items according to the five ‘carreras’ (routes), which included the Carrera a Cartagena, Carrera del Choco, Carrera de Quito, Carrera de Girón and Carrera del Rosario de Cúcuta. Among the highlights, we want to mention the postmarks of Anserma (probably unique), a previously unrecorded example of Carondelet, Tequia (probably unique), extremely rare examples from Chaparral, Gigante, Guadalupe, Mercaderes, Tenerife and Micay, ’’Yndias’’ on transatlantic mail struck in Colombia, etc, all applied during the colonial period. The Republican period is also enriched by very rare postmarks and registered mail.

The gem of the collection is the most important item of Colombian prephilately, featuring the negative circular postmark of Santa Rosa de Cabal, unique including a postal value of franking. This is the only known example of a forerunner postmark prior to the first postage stamps, and it is recorded on just two letters, few weeks before the issue of postage stamps in Colombia.},

The first step was to map postal agencies in activity at some point in postal history, searching their original names, geographic location, the period in which they worked and its geographic and historic environment.

Given the extent of the work, it became imperative to establish a scope with clear limits. Thus, I chose to focus on the philatelic period, that is from 1843, mainly on the cancels that clearly defined the place and date of posting. From the geographic point of view the research area is the state of Rio de Janeiro [1].

The cancels with these characteristics carry the information that make possible its organization and tabulation as in a collection.

The specialized study and collection of postmarks, cancellation and postal markings, known as marcophily or marcophilately was also contemplated in an additional chapter.},

Analyses of more than 40 Argentine postage stamps were carried out non-invasively in situ without the need for prior preparation, using portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (p-XRF) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR). Paper, ink, coatings, and adhesives were analysed and the period of use of each material was established. Some notable results include the continuous use of Prussian blue until its replacement by an organic copper phthalocyanine pigment. In addition, it was possible to establish the substitution date of gum arabic as an adhesive by PVA. In general, the variation of the materials used was accompanied by changes in printing techniques. This is the first time that information on the materiality of these historical-artistic objects is published, contributing to the knowledge and conservation of the philatelic heritage of the Argentine Republic.},

	abstract = {Inorganic pigments have been very important substances for human life for thousands of years. They have contributed and continue to contribute to the beautification of our daily life and habitat and to the accentuation and differentiation of objects, and influence thoughts, moods, and feelings. The industrial manufacture of inorganic pigments based on growing chemical and physical knowledge started around 1800. Before that, pigments based on natural materials or manufactured by mostly empirical processes were used. Most of the technically relevant inorganic pigments were developed and first produced on an industrial scale in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Ongoing developments are aiming to improve existing conventional pigments as well as synthesize new, innovative colorants, especially in the classes of effect pigments and functional pigments. The objective of this text is to present comprehensive knowledge about inorganic pigments, including definitions, types of pigments and their properties, historical pigments, modern inorganic pigments, synthesis methods, and applications. It is also intended to show the current status of new pigment developments.},

	abstract = {A reference collection of mostly 20th century photographic paper was surveyed for the presence of optical brightening agents. Only fiber based, gelatin silver paper was assessed. In all, 1,804 samples were examined, dating from 1896 to 2004 and representing 40 different manufacturers. No optical brightening agents were found in samples dating from 1896 to 1949. The first occurrence of optical brightening agent was found in samples dating between 1950 and 1954. Between 1955 and 1964, the frequency of occurrence for optical brightening agents increased rapidly. Toward the latter part of this date range the occurrence of optical brighteners rose, with 70\% of all samples showing brighteners. Between 1965 and 1979, occurrence of optical brightening agents declined to a low of 39\% of all samples. A marked increase in occurrence was observed after 1980, when 81\% of samples exhibited optical brightening agents. These results indicate that a significant proportion, and for some time periods a significant majority, of black and white, paper-based photographs made after the early 1950s contain optical brightening agents. This finding has implications for the treatment and display of photographs, as the presence of optical brightening agents is not routinely documented and the effects of storage environment, display, and treatment are poorly understood.},

A government lawyer and stamp collector reported the suspicious stamps.  The Duvalier government had to stage a public trial.  Several government officials were sent to jail and the international collectors were satisfied. The trial was an important demonstration of courageous lawyers and judges.  However the principal crooks were not revealed and the officials who were jailed were compensated well and were released early from their comfortable jails. Thus it was proven again in Duvalierist Haiti, which was about prisons, cruelty, and violence, that crime paid. 
 
26 years later, Jean Sénat Fleury, former Haitian judge and legal scholar decided to make this trial available to the new generations of students of justice and those interested in Haitian history,},

	isbn = {978-0-615-80480-4},
	abstract = {At the beginning of the 19th century, the libertarian ideas resulting from the French Revolution began to permeate the conscience of the peoples of the region and by the 20s of this century, with the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico, Spain had already lost all their colonies in America. It should be noted, however, that while all the countries south of the Rio Grande were part of the Spanish colonial empire, they had a relatively organized postal service.

Proof of the above is the wealth of pre-philately in any of those countries. This can be verified in the great international exhibitions in which we usually find exceptional pre-philatelic collections from practically all Latin American countries.

What is currently the Dominican Republic, which under the crown of Spain bore the name of Santo Domingo, is the exception. When the Spanish colonizers moved to Tierra Firme, attracted by the rich deposits of gold and silver in Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, to name just four countries, they abandoned the colony of Santo Domingo, which was submerged, from 1540, in the most abject poverty.

That poverty was reflected in the postal movement. While it is possible to find hundreds of pre-philatelic pieces from almost any Latin American country and many of them can be purchased at prices between \$100 and \$200 dollars, only three covers are known from the Santo Domingo neighborhood, which, the last time they went on the market, sold for prices that exceeded \$20,000 each piece.

As a result of this situation, when in the Dominican Republic we talk about the Spanish mail in Santo Domingo, although we deal with the issue of the postal provisions that the Spanish authorities took in relation to the colony, from the times of Lorenzo de Carvajal until 1795 when the eastern part was ceded to France and during the period between 1808 and 1821 when the colony was reincorporated into Spain, we are essentially talking about the post office implanted by Spain in the colony of Santo Domingo in the period between 1861 and 1865 when the annexation of the country to the Spanish crown.

Although, as we have pointed out, the pre-philately of the Santo Domingo colony is extremely poor, the subject of the Spanish mail in Santo Domingo becomes interesting when it covers everything related to the changes introduced in the Dominican mail by the Spanish authorities that took over of the colony in 1865.},

He begins with the early development of the Levant up to the Congress of Vienna, then shows the developments on land and sea and discusses the early postage rates as well as the introduction of stamps. This alone takes up almost 300 pages and it is fascinating to read how the progress of industrial development was in tune with the expansion of postal routes, the available means of transport and destinations served. Of course, the Austrian Post Office's position in the interplay of powers at the time is not neglected either, as it - like so many others - always endeavoured to increase the Habsburg claim to expansion as far as Asia and Egypt. International postal links to Europe and overseas, postal treaties along various routes were the result and here it is also fascinating how the author deals with these important aspects on an almost global scale. The last 50 years of these developments - from the General Postal Union to the beginning of the First World War - are dealt with more briefly in comparison, but show the new stamp issues in different currencies and new postal services as well as the renewed economic changes.},

	abstract = {Prepared by Thomas Lera, Winton Blount Research Chair The Council of Philatelists Research Committee and William R. Schultz.

COLLECTION SCOPE  \& CONTENT
The Collection of Royal Imperforate Printings of Egyptian Stamps (NPM accession number 233849) consists of one volume of imperforate singles, pairs and blocks of stamps from 1926 to 1952. The collection is housed on the original pages as mounted by George L. Lee.

PROVENANCE
The collection was formed by George L. Lee and donated to the museum on December 23, 1960.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
In April 1926, the Survey Department, a government agency in Cairo, took over the printing of Egyptian stamps. One sheet of each stamp printed by the Survey Department, not those printed out of the country or overprints, was sent to the Royal Collection starting with the 12th Agricultural and Industrial Exposition Issue in 1926 up to and including the stamp celebrating the Birth of Crown Prince Ahmed Fuad in 1952.

The Royal Imperforate Printings were printed on stout, unwatermarked, ungummed paper and were not perforated. On the reverse of each sheet was diagonally printed “cancelled” in English. On later issues, starting in 1947, the printing on the reverse was changed to Arabic by King Farouk.

The Royal Imperforate sheets were confiscated with the rest of the Royal Collection, by the Republic of Egypt when King Farouk was deposed. The Palace Collections of Egypt were auctioned off at the Koubbeh Palace, Cairo on February 12 - 15, 1954 by H. R. Harmer of London.},

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION

Worldwide Postal Stationery, Postal Cards, Envelopes, Letter Sheets, Newspaper Wrappers (both used and unused) are in this outstanding collection of government issued worldwide postal stationery compiled by A. Eugene Michel. It was a bequest to the Smithsonian Institution in 1940. It fills 143 volumes and several boxes which together total over forty thousand objects representing fifty years of intensive and cumulative effort. At the time of its donation, it was ninety-seven percent complete.

Prominent European philatelists had placed the Michel Collection among the world’s best five of its kind. It offers exceptional opportunities for study of cancellations, postal routings, paper textures, watermarkings, sizes and trims, and handwriting during the past one hundred and fifty years. Some of its rarities were formerly in the collection of the late Count Ferrary.},

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
El Salvador: A Short History

The Republic of El Salvador, not “Salvador” as called in almost all philatelic literature and certainly neither the Brazilian city nor the Bahamian island of San Salvador where Christopher Columbus landed during his first journey, is the smallest country in continental America with an area of 21,041 km². Known in the late Pre-Columbian period by its Pipil name Cuzcatlán, El Salvador was discovered by Andres Niño in 1523 and conquered a few years later by Pedro de Alvarado, one of Hernan Cortez's principal lieutenants.

Originally the area of El Salvador belonged administratively to the Captaincy General of Guatemala, part of the province of New Spain (Mexico). In 1821 Central America declared its independence from Spain and was immediately annexed to Mexico, a situation that lasted until 1823 when the Central American provinces shed their ties to Mexico and formed their own Federal Republic. The Federation broke down between 1838 \& 1841, when El Salvador became the last Central American state to declare its autonomy.

In much of Latin America, the 19th century was marked by political instability that slowed economic development. Between 1843 and the end of the century there were 12 presidents, two of whom were elected for more than one term, five of whom were ousted by coups or revolutions and two who were executed. Several attempts to revive the Central American Federation were made, but all of them failed.

The early years of the 20th century brought a period of economic progress and social improvement. However, in 1931 violent unrest, due primarily to the economic depression and the fall of coffee prices, led to the coup d'état of General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, who ruled for 13 years and started a line of military governments that ended in 1979 with the start of the Civil War. The war lasted until 1992, and since then the country has made tremendous advances towards a fully democratic society and better economic conditions.

The earliest known postal piece for El Salvador has been dated around 1780 and bears a pre-philatelic postmark from Santa Ana. The first stamps of El Salvador were issued in 1867, printed by the American Bank Note Company. For several decades, the designs of El Salvador stamps had a clear North American influence as the majority of issues were supplied by American Bank Note Company, Hamilton Bank Note Company and Wright Bank Note Company among others. From the 1950s onwards, the country started to commission stamps in Europe and also to produce them locally. In recent years, the printing has been mostly done by the “Direccion General de Servicios Graficos” (the government printing house in San Salvador) and the subjects depict a combination of events of world-wide importance with local personalities or commemorations.},

COLLECTION SCOPE \& CONTENT
This specialized collection consists of 3 volumes of stamps, artists’ designs, trial color proofs, and related philatelic material from Panama 1906 - 1907.

PROVENANCE
On December 17, 1964, an anonymous donor (Accession Number 258009) gifted to the Smithsonian Institution a specialized three-volume collection of the Hamilton Bank Note Company Republic of Panama Issue of 1906-1907.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
This series of the Republic of Panama stamps was issued in late 1906 and early 1907. It was Panama’s first portrait series and was engraved and printed by the Hamilton Bank Note Company of New York. The ornate frames and colors of each value differ, but the portraits in the center of all are black. The denominations in “Balboas” and “centesimos” replaced “pesos” and “centavos”, a result of the changeover from silver to a gold standard.

There were many orders for these stamps and the colors and paper used differed with each. The first printings were on soft, thick cream-colored paper, the later of lower values on thin, hard, white paper.

Contained in the three volumes are artwork, die proofs, plate proofs, essays, mint stamps, inverted center stamps, and UPU specimens. This finding guide presents historical background of the image illustrated on the stamps as well as what items are found within each volume.},

	abstract = {Prepared by Thomas Lera, Winton M. Blount Research Chair, The Council of Philatelists Research Committee, and Charles C. Wooster, President of the Peru Philatelic Study Circle. 

COLLECTION SCOPE \& CONTENT
The Bernard Peyton Collection consists of 13 volumes of stamps, proofs, essays and covers from Peru from 1779 - 1897.

PROVENANCE
Bernard Peyton of Princeton, New Jersey, donated several significant specialized South American philatelic collections to the Smithsonian’s national philatelic collection.

The specialized collection of Peru, Volumes 1 – 13, was donated on May 24, 1961 (Accession Number 233750).

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
This significant international collection was donated by Bernard Peyton to the Smithsonian national philatelic collection. Most of the collection was formed by Arthur Linz, a prominent philatelic writer, before being acquired by Peyton in the 1950s. The collection begins with a comprehensive pre-stamp postal history of Peru. One very important volume relates to the 1857 Pacific Steam Navigation Company issues, including an outstanding assemblage of essays and proofs, the largest known mint multiples of each of the two values and a 1 Real on cover.

Later issues are very specialized and comprehensive with rarities, varieties, multiples, cancellations and covers. Emphasis is on each of the classic issues, 1858-73, often with a full volume devoted to each issue. There is a modest amount of back-of-the-book material as well.

Finally, of considerable importance is an outstanding collection both off and on cover of the British Agencies in Peru and concluding with several fabulous U.S. and Peru combination covers.},

COLLECTION SCOPE \& CONTENT The John M. Taylor Collection consists of 1 Volume of stamps and covers from Uruguay from 1858 to 1901. 

PROVENANCE The specialized one volume collection of Uruguay was donated by John M. Taylor on December 31, 1957 (Accession Number 217675). 

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION Uruguay's capital, Montevideo, was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold; its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial center competing with Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires. Uruguay's early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing conflicts between the British, Spanish, Portuguese, and colonial forces for dominance in the Argentina-Brazil-Uruguay region.

Uruguay's only land border is with Brazil to the north. To the west lies the Uruguay River, to the southwest lies the estuary of Rio de la Plata, with Argentina only a short commute across the banks of either of these bodies of water, while to the southeast is the South Atlantic Ocean.

This volume covers the specialized early issues from 1858 – 1901, mostly singles, some postal history and Back of the Book Official overprints.},

	abstract = {This article seeks to highlight the postcard as a medium on which an image and the action of someone commenting on the image come together. Four postcards that have been used as sources in historical research are discussed. Absorbed by the practice of photography, the study first focuses on the artist. Then it focus on the role of the model. Finally, it presents the incorporation of the sender and his message. When doing so, it recognizes the surface of this medium as a space for transparency in terms of the social relationships prevailing in Brazil in the early twentieth century. The article also suggests that Manuel Querino was the first intellectual to use a postcard as a bibliographic source.},

	abstract = {The Correios has undergone drastic changes in the last decades due to the appearance of new technologies, both due to the impact of the same on their business, as for the change in the society's behavior. Among the numerous postal marks used, the DH - After Time, indicative of object posted outside the time limit, had a great increase in its use by the  Correios in the last decades, in parallel with the emergence of new special services. The application of the DH mark on the objects is usually done via rubber mark or mechanical franking, but other less usual modus may occur. So this work aims to identify some of these peculiar occurrences and discuss their implications. The methodology used consisted basically of performing a search on a sample of about 7,000 modern circulated
objects. It was confirmed that the application of the DH mark on the observed postal objects occurs mostly as expected. However, other unusual forms of application were identified, such as handwritten, redundant, inverted, and shaved. Cases of omission of its physical application, called omitted, have also been verified, which is worrying, both for philatelic and ethical issues.},

	url = {http://www.levantineheritage.com/pdf/Ottoman-postal-and-telegraph-services-in-the-last-quarter-of-the-nineteenth-century-Aysegul_Okan.pdf},
	abstract = {Public postal services were inaugurated in the Ottoman Empire with the establishment of the Ministry of Post in 1840. The institute was an extension of the new administrative approach which appeared especially with the Tanzimat Decree. The first telegraph lines were installed in 1855, during the Crimean War. In time, the telegraphic network developed rapidly in the Empire. From 1871, the telegraph and postal services were managed from a single administrative center. This thesis tells of the modernization process seen in the Ottoman postal and telegraph services in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The process, which was begun with the membership of the Ottoman State in the Universal Postal Union in 1874 and continued under the reign of Abdülhamid II, created quantitative and qualitative changes in post and telegraph services. The system began to work much more efficiently than it had in the past. Another important finding of the thesis is that the sultan was not the only actor in the process; officials placed in the low ranks of the bureaucratic structure played significant roles in this improvement. The thesis also examines the foreign post offices operating in the Empire. The state struggled with the foreign post offices to obtain its monopoly right over communication systems; although it did not reach certain results, the Ottomans did accomplish the modernization of their own system. The survey depends mostly on primary sources},

Then the solution is 13 cents; since any smaller value can be obtained with at most three stamps (e.g. 4 = 2 + 2, 8 = 5 + 2 + 1, etc.), but to get 13 cents one must use at least four stamps.},

	abstract = {The Spellman, a support-driven non-profit museum featuring an expansive gallery, library, museum store and post-office, offers memberships and various opportunities for engagement and participation.

The Museum has extraordinary exhibits and displays throughout the entire museum that illustrate history, current events, memorable moments in world history, arts and culture, among so many others. 

Called “a hidden gem” and selected as “One Of The 1000 Best Places To Visit in Massachusetts” by the Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism. The Spellman Museum is among the top museums in a Metrowest readers’ poll, and selected as one of Nickelodeon’s top museums for children in the Metrowest area.

The Museum’s mission and goal is to ensure that adults and children can visit this unique and special museum honoring and making available the exploration of stamps and their history.

In addition to vast collections of U.S. stamps and international stamps, the Museum is home to exhibits on broad ranges of subjects with a tie to philatelic content, such as the Holocaust, storybooks, wine and food, kinetic art, history of coffee, quilts, letter writing, origami, children’s puppets, seeing eye dogs, and Helen Keller.

Established in 1963, the Spellman is one of two private stamp museums in the United States, sharing this distinction with The Smithsonian in Washington, DC.  Stamp collection and stamp appreciation is enjoying a resurgence.  The art, history, culture and beauty that postage stamps represent are engaging our nation’s youth, elders, and all of those who share interest in meaningful and fascinating educational content.},

	title = {The overland mail a postal historical study of the mail route to {India}},
	url = {http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/888205.html},
	abstract = {This record of the "Overland Mail" to India covers the comparatively short period when our growing responsibilities in the Orient necessitated quicker and better organized means of communication than by the long sea passage round the Cape ?before the opening of the Suez Canal; "overland" being across Europe to the Mediterranean and over the land-bridge between Africa and Asia from Alexandria to Suez. There had been other, older and even more direct overland routes to the East with their postal services, but, efficient as they were, they had never become "official." Of special interest to philatelists, the book also serves a useful purpose in putting before the ordinary reader a most interesting period in the history of postal communications. Earlier records carry the reader back to the days when the West had to wait a year (or two) for a reply to a letter to India and was lucky if it got one. Only a century ago the round voyage to India might last a year. Nowadays we demand instant connection with India by radio-telephone and expect a letter to be delivered in four days. The pioneer of this early nineteenth-century attempt at a short-cut was Lieutenant T. F. Waghorn, r.n., for some time a pilot on the Hoogli in the Bengal Marine Service. He must have been a man of great parts and excep- tional perseverance, for in spite of official antagonism and discouragement he succeeded in being "the first to demonstrate the practicability beyond dispute of the route over Egypt for regular use on a large scale," and having failed to get the support of the East India Company he set up his own Overland Agency, offering to carry letters at 5s. each to Bombay, the transit averaging 74 days out and 64 for return. After a some what chequered career in Egypt, and being ousted by competition, he transferred his attention to reorganizing the transit of passengers and mails across Europe. It would appear that what should have been "a great Imperial enterprise" became the obsession of a single individual who had the vision to foresee its possibilities. Lieutenant Waghorn gave his life and his private fortune in the cause, and got no thanks until now the Postal History Society puts on record his remarkable achievements. The book is well indexed, documented, and has useful appendices on diverse matters connected with this and other routes such as the Euphrates Valley project.},

The article contains basic processing of the stamps image and calculation of characteristic features, on basis of which it will be recognized. The main objective of this article is to use the color information to obtain a set of features which are invariant under translation and rotation. The proposed method of recognizing can be applied in checking the value of post payments. The value of a post stamp is connected with a picture. The picture is represented in the color space where classification is done. The today’s systems of recognition often use classification on the basis of shape. Proposed method enables recognition of postal stamps from mail piece. Sources of errors as well as possible improvement of classification results will be discussed.},

	abstract = {This thesis observes the development of the Austrian military field post installation as well as the military outpost service within the Austrian international U.N. missions. Another main part of this paper tries to analyse Austrian postal service development in connection with the world history of communication in terms of the genesis of official and private news services throughout the centuries. A macro historical review is followed by a national description of Austrian postal history, while regional history is always seen within den greater framework of the European Union. At the heart of the thesis national developments are looked at along civilian and military lines. Inventions like telegraphic installations and the use of the Morse code meant a quicker delivery of important intelligence and a shortening of waiting periods. Contemporary history shows an even faster development of new communication technology in which tools of communication have found their way into everyday life.Like in the overall history of the development of communication transfer, local Austrian progress ran along the same civilian military lines. The Austrian military was naturally affected by worldwide leaps of technology developments and tried to incorporate new techniques into their organisation. Transferring intelligence and soldiers? messages were the most important tasks in times of war and peace. Not only securing troop safety throughout intelligence but also to keep the soldiers? morale up by keeping the contact to their families and loved ones were highest assignments for the High Command. Especially regarding Austria? s UN mission, a functioning postal field service was important to keep up the contact between soldiers and their families at home. A well shaped and functioning courier service has always been important while conducting freedom missions or in times of war.},

	abstract = {This postal history talk deals with the commercial usages of the three high values of the first stamps of Israel (Doar Ivri or Hebrew Post) issued on May 16, 1948. The discussion will focus on:
- The usages of each of the three high values on commercial airmail , commercial parcel post and commercial documents during 1948-1950;
-The reasons why this mail is rare and highly sought after;
-The alternatives to the three high values available to pay high rate postage and revenue fees during 1948-1950; and
-The immediate successors to the three high values issued during 1950-1952.

Ed’s talk is based in part on his book “The Doar Ivri Issue of Israel:Postal and Commercial Usages of the Three High Value Stamps” published in 2020 by the Society of Israel Philatelists Inc.},
